            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Chriſtian Reader:</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is an uſuall ſaying, <hi>A good thing cannot bee too common:</hi> the worth and profitableneſſe of this Booke is well knowne of the learned every where: being (and indeed deſervedly) eſteemed one of the beſt and choiſeſt Commentaries, that is now extant upon the <hi>Revelation.</hi> And if we conſider the perillous times wherein wee are, I know no worke more ſeaſonable for our inſtruction and comfort touching the preſent Commotions and uproares in the world. For here we ſhall find, that it is neceſſary, that ſuch things come to paſſe, to the end the words of this Propheſie may be fulfilled: we have all need (as the Apoſtle ſaith) of patience: now what will more perſwade us to be quiet, contented, comforted, then to looke into the <hi>Revelation of Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> where we ſhall find all the conflicts and combats of the Godly, againſt the <hi>Dragon, Beaſt,</hi> and <hi>Falſe-prophet</hi> moſt clearly ſet forth, and none of our ſufferings in any way or kind to be otherwiſe, then what was fore-appointed in the unchangeable decree of God. Moreover here we have ſet downe with the finger of God, the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine event and iſſue of the whole warre: namely Antichriſts deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the glorious and happy victory of the Saints. A man of a weake and cowardly Spirit, will cheerfully fight, if he know before hand that he ſhall ſurely overcome. This aſſurance all true Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers have, that they ſhalbe more then Conquerors through him that loveth them, and therefore they have cauſe enough to ſtand faſt, hold their owne, fight the good fight of faith: ſeeing it is without queſtion, that they ſhall overcome in the blood of the Lambe: But of this I need not here ſpeake, conſidering how largely and ſweetly this matter is treated of in this Commentary.</p>
            <p>It is not my purpoſe to ſpeake any thing in the behalfe of the Tranſlator, or in the praiſe of his worke: leaſt that in the Proverbs <hi>Chap.</hi> 27.14. ſhould be applied to me. Wherefore what is here done, I leave to the triall and judgement of all ſober and godly minded Readers. Onely I muſt needs ſay that it would be a ſingular bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to our Nation, if there were more of <hi>Pareus</hi> his workes tranſlated into our Engliſh tongue. And for ought I do perceive, the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator of this hath ſome purpoſe ſo to do, if this (which is the firſt) doe finde a faire and friendly acceptance. And I have no reaſon to thinke otherwiſe: Conſidering how well M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
               <hi>Brightman</hi> on the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation is approved of: Now howſoever I will not ſpeake any thing in the leaſt to his diſparagement: notwithſtanding ſeeing <hi>Pareus</hi> was
<pb facs="tcp:96676:3"/>a later Writer, <hi>an Interpreter one among a thouſand,</hi> a man of an acute and deepe judgement, and one that had his thoughts and meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the worke 30. yeares: in theſe and other reſpects the Reader may well make account to meete here with many things, more for his ſatisfaction then hitherto he hath ever had: and that he may the ſooner ſee with his owne eyes the trueth of what I ſpeake, I ſhall adviſe him in the firſt place carefully to read <hi>Pareus</hi> his Preface: for it will much helpe him, to the better underſtanding of the following Commentary.</p>
            <p>And thus committing the worke to the favourable acceptance of religious and judicious mindes, beſeeching the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to bleſſe and proſper it for his glory, and for the conſolation and edification of all thoſe that ſeek his favour, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to feare his Holy Name, <hi>I reſt</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Had thought indeed never to have ſet forth this <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary upon the Revelation,</hi> long ſince expounded in the <hi>Academie</hi> in CLXXXVIII-<hi>Lectures,</hi> but to have left the ſame unto my children for their proper uſe: and this for divers cauſes: eſpecially finding that as yet I had not touched the height of the myſteries, neither ſhould eaſily ſatisfie others, having in many things not ſatisfied my ſelfe. In the meane while I thought it requiſite with all diligence to ſearch out the judgements of more learned Interpreters in the harder matters: and not to neglect whatſoever might ſeem in the Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries of ancient and modern Interpreters to conduce for the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of the work: as not being ignorant of the admonition of <hi>Horace,</hi>
               <q xml:lang="lat">
                  <l>(Membranis intus poſitis, delere licebit,</l>

               </q> 
               <hi>That a man may alter or blot out his private writings, which are not made publicke: but the word that is out cannot be recalled.</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it happened of late (I know not by what providence) that at length I aſſented to the publiſhing thereof, at the earneſt requeſt of friends: who judged it a thing unfit, that the Church, (no weighty reaſon hindering the ſame) ſhould any longer be deprived of this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: be it whatſoever it be: perſwading themſelves that by me ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more would be publiſhed touching theſe myſteries, then as yet was extant. And that the things yet hid, are perhaps of that nature, which either God hath reſerved unto his own power, or are better not to be known, then known by us: of which kind ſome things are,

            </p>
            <p>They added that now there was ſpeciall uſe to vindicate this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, it being publickly depraved by new feigned Oracles and falſe Gloſſes, as if it did eſtabliſh <hi>Romish Idolatry,</hi> and Patronize Popiſh Tyranny, from which notwithſtanding it portendeth nothing but ſad evils unto the Godly, and moſt miſerable calamities unto the Church, the which the <hi>Revelation</hi> ſetteth forth by lively colours, as it were the very Kingdome of Antichriſt himſelfe, under the type of a <hi>Beaſt</hi> and <hi>Falſe-Prophet:</hi> All which they affirme is made appeare throughout this Commentary: by which reaſons being over-ſwayed, I gave way to the publiſhing thereof, yet ſo as this Sacred and laſt <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> or <hi>gratefull Gift</hi> ſhould be dedicated unto none, ſave unto my Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>If therefore ſo it be, that in the opening of theſe myſteries I may
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96676:4"/>ſeem unto ſome in any place to come ſhort: theſe I lovingly deſire to ſupply my defect with their greater diligence: pardoning in the mean time what is not yet attain'd to, &amp; being tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kfull for what is found out. But &amp; if there ſhalbe any, who wreſt my expoſitions touching the <hi>beaſt,</hi> or his <hi>head,</hi> or <hi>horns,</hi> or the like myſteries, unto the offence and injury of any mans perſon: to theſe I teſtifie, that I have written nothing to the reproch or ſcandal of any man: but truly and candidly expounded what our Saviour <hi>Chriſt</hi> reveald unto <hi>Iohn,</hi> not to the injury, but rather inſtruction and Salvation of all ſuch as deſire to be ſaved, nor unto the offence, but admonition and amendment of ſuch as wil not periſh.</p>
            <p>Neither am I the firſt who have thus expounded the <hi>Beaſt.</hi> What ſpeake I of my ſelfe? Neither was the Apoſtle John the firſt who ſhewed Antichriſt at <hi>Rome:</hi> for before him <hi>Paul</hi> teſtified, that the <hi>Son of perdition should ſit in the Temple of God as God,</hi> that is, claim the <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipallity</hi> in the Church: for even then the <hi>myſterie of iniquitie was a working,</hi> except it had bin for that which did <hi>with-hold,</hi> that is, as <hi>Chryſoſtom, Ambroſe, and Ierom</hi> interpret it, the <hi>Romane Empire:</hi> which firſt being tranſlated from the <hi>mountains of Rome</hi> to ſome other place, and weakned, ſhould as it were be aboliſhed.</p>

Therefore looke into it, and read the condemnation of the great whore, ſitting upon many waters, and there contemplate thy worthy acts, and what shall befall thee.</hi> Hath not the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſufficiently noted that thou art he <hi>that ſitteſt in the temple of God as God?</hi> why then ſhouldeſt thou not ſuſpect all that thou doſt, and haſt? <hi>Thy two horns</hi> like <hi>the Lambs:</hi> thy <hi>two keyes,</hi> and the <hi>two ſwords</hi> in thy hand: the <hi>Triple Crown</hi> on thy head: the <hi>myſterie in thy forehead:</hi> the <hi>Image</hi> which thou cauſeſt the inhabitants of the earth to worſhip, killing them that refuſe to do it: the <hi>name</hi> and the <hi>number of thy name:</hi> the Maſſe and Latine Leturgie: the whoriſh woman ſitting upon Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Mountaines: now oughteſt thou not to ſuſpect all theſe?</p>
            <p>And ye O unwiſe Kings: when will ye underſtand, whom to ſerve and what ye ſhould do? when will God put it into your hearts to doe his will, that is, to make <hi>Rome</hi> the whoriſh woman deſolate? <hi>Oh ſerve the Lord with feare and trembling, kiſſe the Son leaſt he be angry, and yee perish in the way:</hi> let the <hi>Lambe</hi> conquer you, not unto deſtruction, like as the <hi>Beaſt</hi> overcommeth, but unto converſion: do it (o kings) ſpeedily, leaſt it be too late. For God will not be mocked. He hath begun to put into the hearts of diverſe good Kings to do this willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: He will alſo put into the hearts of others, when it ſhall pleaſe him, according to the oracle of the Angell.

                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.17.</note> And already hath he perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the hearts of ſome Emperours deceaſed, even in their ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, to approach before the Tribunall of God not by <hi>invocating of Mary,</hi> but by imploring the divine mercy, and ſo rendred their ſoules to God their Saviour, not in confidence of the Churches treaſure, but the alone merits of Jeſus Chriſt. He put alſo into the heart of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great Zelot in his ſicke bed, to turne his face from the Prieſt, chanting prayers to the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and promiſing him Salvation by his owne and the Saints merits, thereby teſtifying, that he deſired to be rayſed up by the interceſſion and merits of Chriſt. They that ceaſe to do thus ſhall not be partakers of Salvation. They which do it ſeriouſly, verily they are overcome by the Lambe unto their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and they make the whore deſolate late indeed, yet not too late. But let no man tempt God: for ye know not how ſoone yee may be taken away. While therfore it is time walke in the light, leaſt the darkneſſe come upon you.</p>
            <p>Neither let flatterers deceive you, who ſay, that it ſeems harſh, diſhonourable, and unbeſeeming, <hi>that ſo many Princes warre againſt the Lambe, follow the Beaſt, are Antichriſts Vaſſals, that the greateſt part of the Empire conſiſts of Antichriſt, who is to be caſt into the Lake of Fire.</hi> This is the deceitfull ſong of Sirenes. To begin with the laſt particular, How I pray ſhall the greateſt part of the Empire conſiſt of Antichriſt, if our trueth doth ſtand that the Pope is Antichriſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe either the <hi>Pope</hi> be ſaid to be the greateſt part of the Empire, then which nothing is more falſe, and opprobrious to the Empire, or that theſe men do meerly triflle? But will they deny them to be Kings touching whom the <hi>Revelation</hi> hath foretold ſuch things? Or wil they accuſe the Revelation to caſt diſhonourable aſperſions upon Kings?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:96676:5"/>
               <hi>They ſay:</hi> that Pagan, not Chriſtian Kings are ſpoken of. But this is neither agreeable to the Revelation, nor to their owne fiction. For the <hi>Kings, who shall give their power to the Beaſt and fight againſt the Lambe,</hi> ſhall be the ſame, into whoſe hearts God will put it <hi>to hate the whore and make her deſolate.</hi> Now this argues that they ſhall not be Pagan but Chriſtian Kings, who before being deceived through ignorance, ſhall ſin in fact: but at length being overcome by the <hi>Lamb,</hi> that is, brought to repentance; they ſhall, forſaking their error, turne their hearts and power againſt the <hi>whore.</hi> Neither can any man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he bee deprived of underſtanding deny, that theſe things are couched in the Text.</p>
            <p>And if credit be given unto their fiction,

            <p>Now tel me, what harſhneſſe or diſhonour is there in it, that (as Paul confeſſeth he was ſometime a blaſphemer, a perſecutor, and injurious, but ignorantly, and ſo obtained mercy:) the <hi>ten Kings</hi> have given their power unto the Beaſt againſt the Lamb: but of ignorance: and being overcome by the <hi>Lambe</hi> have repented: God putting it into their hearts to hate the <hi>whore? Tell me,</hi> I ſay, ſhould this be to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of Kings, which is to their great glory, to have ſinned indeed through ignorance, but repented through the mercy of God? Or is not rather the fiction of theſe Prophets very reproachfull, ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and fatall, who ſay, that toward Antichriſts riſing there ſhalbe no where any Emperor or Romane Empire: that there ſhalbe no King in any place ſave thoſe <hi>ſeven</hi> (that remaine of the ten) fighting for Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.

But to grant, what they ſay, that the <hi>stile</hi> doth differ, was the ſame kinde of ſpeech to be uſed in writing the Goſpell, and a Propheſie? what marveil, that an unlike matter is explicated by a different ſtile. Beſides it is to bee obſerved, that <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote moſt part of the Booke not in his owne words, but in Phraſes and words dictated by the Angell.

               <p>NOw by theſe things the divine Authority of the Booke doth neceſſarily follow. For if the Apoſtle Iohn be the Author: the Divine and Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Authority cannot juſtly bee queſtioned. For the Apoſtles writings are Apoſtolicall.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the Author doth againe and againe teſtifie, that he received his <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from Chriſt,</hi> and wrote the ſame by the Augels command.</p>
               <p>This alſo the teſtimony of the Ancient Church confirmeth.
<note place="margin">Concil. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyran, in appendice.</note> For the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is alledged under the name of <hi>John,</hi> and as Canonicall Scripture, by the moſt ancient <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Ancyra,</hi> which was before that of <hi>Nice:</hi> alſo in the <hi>Councell of Carthage</hi> III. Can. 47. and ſome others following.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Revelation</hi> alſo hath bin alwayes of Canonicall authority with the Greeke and Latine Fathers: although certaine Graecians before <hi>Dionyſius Alexandrinus</hi> did ſome what ſcruple the ſame: as of old ſome of the Latine Church had their doubts touching the Epiſtle to the Hebrews, becauſe it did ſeeme to favour <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatus,</hi> as <hi>Ierome</hi> writeth unto <hi>Dardanus.</hi> But the ſcruple of one, or a few of the Ancients can no more diſanull the authority of any Canonicall Book of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then the ſcruple of a few now can doe.</p>

               <p>But a man might juſtly wonder that Popiſh Writers do not tremble at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſight of this Booke: and how they are not afraid to explicate the Propheſie by their Commentaries:

<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Viſions.</note> neither defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by notes or markes of times, places, and perſons: but are revealed unto <hi>Iohn</hi> (and ſo written) in darke and aenigmaticall Viſions. It is true, many Viſions in Scripture were plaine, as ſet before the eyes of the mind or bodie,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.5. 1. <hi>Kin.</hi> 6.17 <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.11 <hi>Act.</hi> 23.11</note> ſo King <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzar ſaw a hand writing upon the plaister of the wall: Eliſha</hi> ſaw fiery Charrets round about him: and <hi>Moſes</hi> the <hi>buſh</hi> burning before him: <hi>Peter</hi> a ſheet with foure-footed Beaſts let downe from Heaven unto the Earth: <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw the Lord ſtanding by him in the night, &amp;c. In theſe there was no great difficultie. But there are other Viſions more intricate: when the Images or Repreſentations ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying ſome ſecret thing, are exhibited unto the minds of men, either ſleeping or awake: the myſteries of which except they be revealed are ſo obſcure, as that they cannot be found out by the underſtanding of mortall man. Of this kinde were the dreames of <hi>Pharaoh, Nebuchadnezzar:</hi> the Viſions alſo of <hi>Ezechiel, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Zacharie,</hi> unto which we worthily may compare the Viſions of the Revelation. The ſecrets indeed of the aforeſaid dreames, God not onely revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto the ſingular benefit of them which dreamt the ſame, but alſo would have them written for the underſtanding of all. But the my ſteries of the Viſions, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he revealed them to his ſervants and Prophets, yet hee kept them ſecret from all other men, namely, that indeed prophane men might alwayes ſet light by things ſo obſcure: but the godly even by the obſcurity thereof be the more ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up to the ſearching out of divine myſteries.
<note place="margin">The obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ought not to keepe us from ſearthing.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And although we can ſcarcely, and with much difficultie come unto the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of all the ſecrets of this Booke: notwithſtanding the difficultie ought not to affright or to keep us from ſearching: but rather ſtir up a more diligent
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96676:8"/>enquiry into the ſame. Many things in the Booke are without any ſhadowes of darke Types, as ſpeaking plainely of the puniſhments of the ungodly, of the bleſſedneſſe and reward of the Saints, &amp;c. in which lies no obſcurity. In many Types alſo the ſignification is plaine, and the Analogie with the things ſignified not obſcure: as the Analogie of the <hi>ſeven Candleſtickes,</hi> with the <hi>ſeven Churches,</hi> of the <hi>Lamb</hi> with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of the <hi>woman</hi> with the <hi>Church,</hi> of the <hi>Dragon</hi> with <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> of the <hi>Beast</hi> and <hi>Falſe-Prophet</hi> with <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> of the <hi>Locuſts</hi> with the <hi>devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Monkes,</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> and the <hi>Great Whore</hi> with <hi>Rome,</hi> of the <hi>ſeven heads of the Beaſt</hi> with the <hi>ſeven hils of Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the other more obſcure Viſions we have three helps, by whch in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure wee may dive into the underſtanding of them, <hi>viz.</hi> the Propheticall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Hiſtorie, and experience.</p>
               <p>For <hi>firſt,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> after we have compared the Types of the Revelation with the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Phraſes of the ancient Prophets,
<note place="margin">Remedies of the darknes</note> in ſpeciall with <hi>Ezechiel, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Zacharie:</hi> we ſhall find a great likeneſſe in them, and thence receive much light: for example: In Chap. 4.5. it is ſaid, <hi>there were ſeven Lamps of fire burning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the throne:</hi> which plainly appeareth to be taken out of Zach. 4.10. where the ſeven Lampes are ſaid to be the <hi>ſeven eyes of Iehovah running too and fro through the whole Earth.</hi> By which undoubtedly is ſignified the ubiquitie of Gods pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and providence. Out of the ſame Chapter is taken, that in Chap. 11.4. <hi>two witneſſes</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>two Olive trees, and two Candleſticks ſtanding before the face of the Lord of the Earth:</hi> Examples of which kinde we ſhall obſerve many more in the courſe of our Interpretation.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> If from Johns time we diligently run over the Hiſtory of the Empire and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church, and preciſely compare the principall events with the Types of the Revelation, certainly we ſhall ſee much light to come unto theſe Viſions.

               <p>Laſtly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> if we rightly conſider the experience of the preſent times, two nuts are not more alike, then is the <hi>Beast and Purpled Whore</hi> to the Papacy: then the <hi>Locuſts</hi> unto the Popiſh Clergy: then the impure <hi>Frogs</hi> (proceeding out of the mouth of the Dragon, Beaſt, and Falſe-Prophet) unto the Popes Meſſengers, (being hooded like to Frogs) <hi>viz</hi> the Ieſuites cracking miracles, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning too and fro by Sea and Land unto the Kings of the Earth,

               <p>I Have ſpoken of the Authour, and Canonicall Authority, and obſcurity of the Revelation, and ſhewed that in theſe things is nothing to hinder us from the interpretation thereof.</p>
               <p>The objection about the Interpreters is of no weight. I confeſſe that not a few Divines of great account, as <hi>Luther, Melanchthon, Bucer, Martyr, Calvin, Beza,</hi> and others have abſtained from the Interpretation of the Revelation. But this neither doth leſſen the authority of the Booke, neither doth it preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice other Interpreters: for who knowes, whither the darkeneſſe of the Book, or their other waighty labours, or want of time did occaſion the ſame, certaine it is, they no way queſtioned the authority of the Booke.</p>
               <p>In the meane while, in all Ages there have beene excellent Teachers of the Church, who have laboured to illuſtrate the ſecrets of this Booke by their Commentaries.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Luther</hi> alſo publiſhed a ſhort Commentary upon the Apocalyps at <hi>Witeberg</hi> Anno. 1528. ſent unto him out of <hi>Livonia,</hi> having no name unto it: the which <hi>Conr.

But by the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter it appears not to be ſo ancient, for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour there diſputing touching <hi>the thouſand yeeres,</hi> teſtifies, that hee wrote in the yeer, from the Incarnation of Chriſt, 1357. <hi>Which,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is our preſent date.</hi> He often expreſly interpreteth the <hi>Papacy</hi> for Antichriſts kingdom, the <hi>Pope</hi> for Antichriſt: which therefore I rehearſe, leaſt any might imagine, that wee were the firſt Authours of this opinion. Yea <hi>Pope Gregory</hi> above a 1000. yeers ago doubted not confidently to ſay, that that <hi>Prieſt</hi> ſhould be Antichriſt, or his Forerunner, who ſhould arrogate the Title of VNIVERSAL unto himſelf, which a while after, as is knowne, the Biſhops of Rome themſelves did doe.

<note place="margin">Proteſtant Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Revelation</note> have in the foregoing age put their hands to this Propheſie, among whom notwithſtanding in my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Henry Bullinger</hi> of <hi>Helvetia</hi> is moſt eminent, whom almoſt all do follow, as <hi>David Chytraeus, Alfonſus Cunradus, Franciſcus Lambertus, Sebaſtianus Meye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, Nicolaus Collado, Johannes Foxus, Benedictus Aretius, Matthias Illyricus, Auguſtinus Marloratus, Petrus Artopoeus, Franciſcus Iunius: Daniel Toſſanus.</hi> And of late in this our age <hi>Iohn Napier</hi> a Scotchman, <hi>Thomas Brightman</hi> an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhman, <hi>Raphaël Eglinus, Conradus Graſerus</hi> a Germane, <hi>Iohannes Piſcator, Matthias Hoë, Matthias Cotterius</hi> a French man, with others whom I have not ſeene.</p>
               <p>But thou wilt ſay, to what end are all theſe named? To wit to ſhew what I purpoſed, that nothing of the authority of this Booke is hereby diminiſhed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (as hath bin objected) ſome worthy Divines have abſtained from inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting the ſame.</p>
               <p>Touching the manner of interpretation, which every of them hath followed, and whether, being ſo many, they have effected what they deſired and ought to have done: would be too long to explicate, neither is it to the purpoſe in hand. This one thing perhaps may be affirmed without injurie to any of them all, that to this Booke hath happened, what the Evangeliſt <hi>Marke</hi> writeth of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man diſeaſed with an iſſue of blood:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mar.</hi> 5.26</note> 
                  <hi>that ſhee had ſuffered many things of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians, and it availed her nothing, but ſhe became much worſe:</hi> perhaps not ſo much by reaſon of the Phyſitians unskilfullneſſe, as the incurableneſſe of the diſeaſe, namely the healing thereof being reſerved for to illuſtrate the glory of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>For while ſo many (every one following the force and reaſon of his own wit) have uttered ſuch various things touching theſe aenigmaticall Viſions, piouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as I ſuppoſe, yet little cohering with themſelves, or with the ſcope or meaning of the Holy Ghoſt: it is come to paſſe, that indeed there are extant an heap of Commentaries upon this Booke, every of which promiſeth a new light unto the Propheſie,
<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting.</note> whereas the obſcurity thereof is not onely not leſſened thereby, but in ſome places alſo more darkened. For <hi>ſome</hi> applie the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigmaes of the Revelation unto the Hiſtory of the Ancient Church: <hi>Others</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly unto the continued period of the New Church: <hi>Others</hi> in every particular
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96676:9"/>have imagined unto themſelves myſticall meanings, thinking, as the ſaying is, that under every ſtone gold lay hid: <hi>Others</hi> turned all things into tropes and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Allegories: <hi>Others</hi> have laboured prophetically to praeſage and find out fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture things, even more then was lawfull for men to know: yea hardly among ſo many (which commonly is ſaid of Chronicles) thou ſhalt find two or three agree: which diſagreement verily argues that the difficultie of the Booke is not yet by ſo great variety of Authours wholly taken away, but rather encreaſed: not ſo much by a blame-worthy ignorance of Interpreters, as in regard of the incomprehenſible wiſdome of the Propheſie it ſelfe: the full revelation whereof is undoubtedly reſerved unto the manifeſtation of Chriſt our Lord.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding I write not theſe things touching Interpreters, as if I would detract any thing from the labours of ſo many learned men, or thought that by their labour nothing of theſe myſteries were brought to light or explicated: and that I at length in all theſe Aenigmaes, had (as the ſaying is) hit the naile on the head. Far be it: for I doubt not in the leaſt, but that a great part of theſe Types by foregoing and preſent events are ſo manifeſtly brought to light, that the trueth of them may daily bee ſeene and felt, of ſuch, who, as the Holy Ghoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) have underſtanding. Yea I ingeniouſly profeſſe that I have bin very much helped by the Commentaries of moſt of them, eſpecially <hi>Bullingers</hi> and <hi>Brightmans.</hi> Now what I further judge touching the whole form method, and manner of interpreting the Revelation, I will by and by ſhew.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER. V. <hi>Of the dignity, time, profit, and ſcope of this Propheſie.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Have ſpoken of the Authour and authority, of the obſcurity and Interpreters of the Revelation: and thus I have freed this Booke from a three-fold ſlander: <hi>first</hi> as if it were not <hi>Canonicall: ſecondly</hi> obſcure, as not to be underſtood: <hi>third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> of <hi>neglect,</hi> as if for this cauſe the worthieſt Divines had hitherto ſhunned the interpretation thereof.</p>
               <p>There remaine two other ſcandals to be taken away: one of the <hi>order:</hi> that this <hi>Booke</hi> is the laſt of the New Teſtament: the other of <hi>errour:</hi> that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines ſomethings not agreeable to Apoſtollical Faith: both theſe clouds will be diſperſed by the conſideration of the dignity of this Propheſie, which (like the Morning Starre above the reſt) ſhineth moſt clearely among the other Bookes of the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>What therefore reſpects the Order, ſo farre is it from diminiſhing the worth of the Booke in any kind, as it the more commendeth the ſame. For it is in very deed a divine Seale, by which the Holy Ghoſt was pleaſed, not without-reaſon, to cloſe up both the Old and the New Canon of the divine Scriptures: which manifeſtly appeareth from that propheticall Proteſtation at the end of the Booke, by which ſuch are pronounced bleſſed who obſerve the words of this Propheſie: the falſifiers on the contrary that preſume to adde or take ought there-from, are threatned with curſes: for <hi>unto them that adde,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.18</note> God ſhall adde the plagues that are written in this Booke: to them that take, away,
<note place="margin">The Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed from the order thereof.</note> God ſhall take away his part out of the Booke of Life, and out of the</hi> HOLY CITY, <hi>and from the things that are written in this Booke.</hi> What could be expreſſed more honourable concerning this Propheſie: for if it be unlawfull to adde ought ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: then certainly in all reſpects it is abſolute, perfect, divine, and the word of God, unto which nothing without impiety may bee added by men. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine if nothing may be taken away from the ſame, then it is Sacred, inviolable, divine, and the word of God, which onely <hi>cannot bee broken.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.35.</note> Thus we ſee that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96676:10"/>the Canonicall dignity of this Booke is eſtabliſhed by the order it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>And hereby it is plainly made equall with the divine Bookes of <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12.32.</note> the Prince of Prophets. For as thoſe, becauſe they are the firſt of the Sacred Canon, are often confirmed with this Seale: <hi>Ye ſhall not adde unto the word which I command you, neither ſhall ye diminiſh ought from it,</hi> &amp;c. So this Booke as it were cloſing the Holy Canon, is confirmed with the like Seale: <hi>that nothing may bee added to it, nothing taken away from it:</hi> As Moſes therefore was the Chieftaine of the Prophets, leading the firſt rankes: So <hi>John</hi> was chiefe of the Prophets, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up, or leading the laſt rankes: and here I willingly aſſent to <hi>Bezas</hi> opinion, moſt ſolidly and truely affirming, <hi>that it ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt to gather into this pretious Booke,
<note place="margin">In praefat. Apoc.</note> thoſe things which remained to be fulfilled after Christs comming, of the praedictions of the former Prophets: and alſo to adde ſome things, ſo farre as concerned us to know.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Praefat. in Daniel.</note> A like honourable Title that worthy Divine JOHN OECOLAM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PADIUS giveth unto this Booke: <hi>That it is the best Interpreter of all the Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither will I ſpeake more touching the order ſave this one thing, that in it appeareth alſo a manifeſt reaſon of time.
<note place="margin">When the Revelation was written</note> For it is the laſt Booke of the New Teſtament, not becauſe it is laſt in dignity, but in time. For <hi>Ierome</hi> writeth, that <hi>Domitian</hi> raiſing after <hi>Nero</hi> the ſecond perſecution againſt the Chriſtians, <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote the Revelation in the 14. yeer of his reigne in the Ile called <hi>Patmos.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In vita Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannis.</note> With whom <hi>Irenaeus</hi> a moſt ancient Writer doth agree, affirming, that John ſaw the Revelation not long before his time, <hi>but almoſt,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>in our age, towards the end of Domitian his Empire.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Wherefore the Apocalyps was written in the ninety ſixth yeer of Chriſt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all the other Bookes of the New Teſtament were written. For <hi>Iohn</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived all the Apoſtles and Canonicall Writers, and lived (as <hi>Sophronius</hi> records) untill the third yeere of <hi>Trajane,</hi> which from Chriſts birth was Anno 102: and after his paſſion (as <hi>Ierome</hi> recordeth) 68.
<note place="margin">In vita Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannis.</note> and from the deſtruction of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem 25. Now whereas ſome affirme that <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote his Goſpell after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, it is without any probabilitie. But we come to ſpeake of the utility of the Revelation.</p>
               <p>This Booke doth excellently ſhine forth in point of doctrine: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> for it truely teacheth the Propheticall and Apoſtolicall Faith, and much illuſtrates many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Goſpell,
<note place="margin">The profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablenes of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</note> or common places. In ſpeciall it proveth the eternall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of Chriſt with ſuch weighty arguments, as ſcarcely more excellent are to be found in any other part of Scripture: abſolutely aſcribing unto Chriſt many attributes, which are onely proper unto <hi>Iehovah: viz.</hi> that he is <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mega,</hi> the <hi>first and the laſt, the beginning and the end:</hi> the Almighty: that the Lambe ſtanding in the Throne of the Deity, equall in majeſty with the Father, is worſhipped by all the Heavenly Inhabitants, that he judgeth the adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, rules the Nations with an iron rod, that hee is the King of kings, and Lord of lords, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It plainely alſo maintaineth the Doctrine of Chriſts Mediatorſhip, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> and work of our Redemption through his blood, calling him <hi>the faithfull Witneſſe, the Firſt begotten from the dead,
<note place="margin">Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of chriſt:</note> the Prince of the kings of the earth, the Lambe ſlaine from the beginning of the world,</hi> who hath waſhed us in his blood from our ſins, and made us Prieſts and Kings to God and the Father, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It ſets forth the afflicted ſtate and condition of the Church in this life, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the <hi>latter times,</hi> by evident types, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>woman</hi> bringing forth a <hi>Man-Child,</hi> the Ruler of the Nations, ſhall be driven into the Wilderneſſe by <hi>the Dragon</hi> and <hi>the Beast,</hi> where ſhe ſhall remaine hid from the ſight of men, when the <hi>two Witneſſes</hi> ſhall propheſie againſt the <hi>Dragon</hi> and <hi>the Beaſt,</hi> and ſhall indeed be ſlaine, but being againe rayſed to life, they ſhall bee taken up into Heaven, &amp;c. By which verily it is manifeſt that nothing elſe is ſignified, then that the Church in Antichriſts reigne ſhall bee obſcure, and ſecret in the

               <p>By which that cavill is eaſily anſwered: <hi>Where the Church was before Luthers time, if the Papacy were not.</hi> The Papacy indeed was the Apoſtaticall Church, it was <hi>Babylon,</hi> having nothing but the bare Name of the Holy Citie.

               </p>
               <p>By which we ſee,
<note place="margin">The expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyps nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſary.</note> that this Booke is not onely worthy to be continually read in the Church and meditated on: but alſo to containe very profitable and nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſary Doctrines, eſpecially for this laſt age. For the Jeſuites Antichriſts chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Souldiers are very ingenious to corrupt, and wreſt the plaine Oracles of this Propheſie into a contrary meaning, as if they were not onely not to be applied againſt the Papacy, but alſo did make for the dignity thereof: wherefore alſo it is our duty diligently to labour, that the <hi>Revelation</hi> may be familiarly expounded and knowne: not ſuffering the ſame to be depraved: leaſt we our ſelves be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the ſlights of Antichriſt, or that by our careleſneſſe wee ſuffer others to be enſnared by pernitious errours.</p>
               <p>Now this wee ſhall the more eaſily attaine unto, if wee alwayes have the Scope of this Booke before our eyes, like as Mariners doe the more ſafely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect their courſe in the vaſt Sea, by looking up unto the ſtarres. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall ſcope thereof was.
<note place="margin">The ſcope of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation:</note>
               </p>
               <p>FIRST, <hi>generall,</hi> That the Chriſtian Church being fore-warned of her fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture condition after the Apoſtles time, even unto the end of the world, ſhould not promiſe perpetuall delight and eaſe unto her ſelfe, but timely bee prepared manfully to ſuſtaine the <hi>battles</hi> at hand.</p>
               <p>SECONDLY, <hi>ſpeciall:</hi> leaſt the Godly (even then groaning under the <hi>Romane perſecutions,</hi> and calamities which were to endure yet a long time) beeing offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſhould be diſcouraged: but know that it came to paſſe, becauſe the Lord had revealed unto his ſervant <hi>John</hi> that it ſhould bee ſo: and withall that they might be raiſed up with ſure comforts of an happy iſſue out of their calamities: for this cauſe alſo Chriſt in the Goſpell forewarned his Diſciples of the Croſſe and future ſorrow, that when it came they might remember that it had been foretold unto them: <hi>For the darts which are foreſeen, ſtrike the leſſe, and we doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the evils of the world more tolerably, if we be fenced againſt them through the ſhield of providence,</hi> ſaith GREGORY.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi> foraſmuch as not long after the <hi>Romane perfecutions,</hi> Satan, through the riot, ambition and contention of the Biſhops of the Churches, was to erect <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts throne</hi> in the Temple of God, the Holy Ghoſt in ſpeciall would have his forme, nature, reigne, and Tyranny to bee ſet forth (as it were) in lively colours unto us, that we might learne the better to know, reſiſt, and take heed of him.</p>
               <p>Moreover he would have the deſtruction and puniſhment of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96676:11"/>all other adverſaries: as alſo the victory and future glorification of the Church to be plainly deſcribed, leaſt either we ſhould envy the preſent proſperity of the adverſaries, or overmuch fear their Tyranny: but that on the contrary we might be patient under the Croſſe, and conſtant in our Combats, retaining an aſſured hope of victory, deliverance, and future glory, even unto the end.</p>
               <p>Now that, beſides theſe ſcopes that <hi>upſtart Inquirer</hi> labours to wreſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volation to this purpoſe,

                  </note> as if it ſhould teach, <hi>that</hi> ROME, <hi>of old the head of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Idolatry, by an admirable viciſſitude was to bee changed into the Metropolis of the Catholicke Church, that the Romane Church was gloriouſly to triumph both in reſpect of the Romane Citie, and the whole Empire, and that the ſoveraigne authority of the Romiſh Pope ſhould alwayes remaine in the height of honour:</hi> is ſuch a filthy and impudent depravation of this moſt ſacred Propheſie: that even the Divell himſelfe ought to bluſh thereat: and I ſhould wonder if theſe goodly trifles do not cauſe laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or ſhame even to the <hi>Romiſh Court</hi> it ſelfe. But theſe things a little after are to be more neerly examined, when we come to the Argument. Enough touching the Order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The things which have been objected againſt the Booke, as being er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous and contrary to the Faith: in ſpeciall that it ſeemes in Chap. 20. to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the brutiſh doctrine of the Hereticke <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> touching Chriſt and the Saints worldly and voluptuous Reigne on Earth a Thouſand Yeers before the V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall Reſurrection of the dead: doth not at all trouble me. For if the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections of Heretickes or Pagans had preſently been believed, wee ſhould long ſince have had nothing entire in the whole Scripture: but all theſe things have long agoe beene vindicated by ancient and later Interpreters: and wee referre the clearing of every of them to their proper places, leaſt our Preface ſhould bee too tedious.</p>

                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.3.</note> however by what hath beene ſaid already, it is not obſcure, yet I will handle the ſame more neerly.</p>
               <p>The principall and greater part of the Booke is propheticall (hence in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beginning it is called a Propheſie) containing Typicall Propheſies not onely touching the ſtate of the Church and the ſignes of the laſt times, of which Chriſt foretold his Diſciples,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.</note> like as <hi>Ribera</hi> thought good to explicate the Argument of the Apocalyps, viz. <hi>that it is nothing elſe but certaine Commentaries upon thoſe words of our Lord.</hi> For they extend themſelves much larger unto the times next after the Apoſtles, and thence from the giving of the Revelation, even unto the end of the world: namely touching the preſent conflicts of the Chriſtian Church, which already were in <hi>Johns</hi> time, and afterwards ſhould continually befall her: <hi>firſt,</hi> with <hi>Romane Tyrants, afterward</hi> with diverſe Heretickes: and <hi>at length</hi> both with the Eaſterne, and eſpecially the Weſterne <hi>Antichriſt:</hi> as alſo of their inſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and tyranny againſt her, by which as if ſhee were forſaken of Chriſt her head, they ſhould grievouſly both inwardly and outwardly afflict, and almoſt whollie oppreſſe her. But withall on the contrarie of the moſt ſweet comforts of the godly under the Croſſe, that thoſe ſtormes of afflictions ſhould not befall them at a venture, or onely at the luſt and will of the adverſaries: but by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering hand of God, for the exerciſe of the Church: neither yet ſhould they be perpetuall or continue too long: but at length bee changed with the heavenly glory of the Saints: all the wicked being by the power of Chriſt the Conqueror, caſt into the lake of fire and brimſtone for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Booke</hi> alſo is doctrinall and hortatorie mixing here and there with oracles

               <p>The <hi>generall</hi> is of the Argument of the whole Revelation: <hi>that it deſcribes a two-fold warre of the Church: one with the Synagogue, the other with Paganiſme, and a two-fold victory and triumph over both adverſaries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the <hi>former</hi> warre with the Synagogue was already fought before the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie was revealed: and the Synagogue with the Temple lay in aſhes. To what purpoſe then ſhould this warre have been ſhewed unto John as being to come afterward? <hi>Like as,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>things done are repreſented in a Comoedie.</hi> As if forſooth, Chriſt would repreſent unto John things done, and not rather, <hi>which were to come to paſſe afterward.</hi> As for the <hi>latter</hi> warre with Paganiſme, although it was then on foot very hot already, and was further to lie more heavy upon the Chriſtians: notwithſtanding a more fierce conflict by farre with Antichriſt was to befall them (not to ſpeake of the <hi>Gogiſh Warre</hi>) by whom the Church (as is praefigured in the Apocalyps) ſhould grievouſly be oppreſſed unto the very laſt times, and againſt whom victory and triumph is promiſed unto the Saints, the which all Interpreters, the Papiſts not excepted, do confeſſe.</p>
               <p>Of his <hi>ſpeciall</hi> hypotheſes the <hi>first</hi> is, that in the <hi>firſt eleven Chapters</hi> is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the rejection of the Jewiſh Nation, and the deſolation of the City Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem by the Romanes.</p>
               <p>The SECOND: That <hi>in the nine following Chapters</hi> is portended the Empire of the <hi>Romane Church</hi> over Rome and the whole world, and the overthrow of Paganiſme: the which forſooth ſhould bee that horrible judgement of the <hi>Great Whore</hi> and deſtruction of Babylon, effected by <hi>Constantine the Great</hi> and his Succeſſours.</p>
               <p>The THIRD: That in the two laſt Chapters under the Type of the <hi>Lambes Bride</hi> and <hi>the New Jeruſalem,</hi> is ſet forth the glorious and triumphant ſtate of the <hi>Romane Church</hi> in Heaven.</p>
               <p>But theſe moſt idle vanities will ſoon vaniſh away, if thou doeſt but even put them to the Touch-ſtone, that is, the very Text of the Propheſie:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Veſtig. nota</hi> 14. <hi>prooem.</hi>
                  </note> for Chriſt did reveale thoſe things to Iohn <hi>which ſhould ſhortly bee done,</hi> Chap. 1.1. and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward Chap. 4.1. whereas therefore the deſtruction of Ieruſalem, and reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Iewes, by <hi>Alcaſars</hi> owne confeſſion was fulfilled XXV. yeeres before the Revelation was given. Who then ſhould believe that Chriſt would have revealed unto Iohn for a great myſterie, a Hiſtory ſo generally known, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch obſcure Types: <hi>Iohns Revelation propheſieth of things preſent and to come,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

               <p>Neither is the <hi>ſecond</hi> more true. For the judgement of the <hi>Great Whore,</hi> and the ruine of Babylon is repreſented not as a grace of converſion, but as a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of whoredom to be inflicted on the kingdom &amp; ſeat of Antichriſt in the laſt times. Therefore to interpret this of the converſion of <hi>Rome</hi> and Paganiſme un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Faith of Chriſt, which came to paſſe three hundred yeers after Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and his Succeſſours, is to make a mooke of reaſon.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third</hi> is no better then the reſt. The <hi>Spouſe of the Lambe,</hi> and <hi>the New
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96676:12"/>Jeruſalem,</hi> is the whole Church of Chriſt, gloriouſly triumphing in Heaven, from whom God hath wiped away all teares: in which ſhall bee nothing that is defiled and abominable, as ſhall be afterward ſhewed in its place: but that the now <hi>Romane Apoſtaticall Church,</hi> worſhipper of Idols, mother of fornications, and driver, not of Chriſts aſſe, but of the <hi>Beast of Antichriſt</hi> (while ſhe remains ſuch on earth) ſhould alſo belong unto the Spouſe of Chriſt in Heaven; ſhall then be true, when that of the Apoſtle is falſe: <hi>Be not deceived, neither Fornicators, nor Idolaters,

               <p>THe things hitherto praemiſed, have beene treated of by many Interpreters. That which remaines touching the <hi>forme</hi> and <hi>method of the Revelation,</hi> hath as yet beene obſerved but by few, nay; to ſpeake it with modeſty, I ſcarcely find the ſame explicated by any one.</p>
               <p>The <hi>forme</hi> indeed ſeemes to be Epiſtolarie: having an Epiſtolarie Inſcription
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96676:13"/>and Subſcription, and is ſhut up with an Epiſtolarie wiſh common to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles: all the Acts alſo of the firſt Viſion, are Epiſtle-wiſe.</p>
               <p>But that which beginneth at the fourth Chapter (which is the firſt propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Viſion) and the following unto the end, if you well obſerve them, have plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>Dramaticall</hi> forme,

For as in humane Tragedies, diverſe perſons one after another come upon the Theater to repreſent things done, and ſo again depart: diverſe Chores alſo or Companies of Muſitians and Harpers diſtinguiſh the diverſity of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and while the <hi>Actors</hi> hold up, do with muſicall accord ſweeten the wearineſſe of the Spectators, and keepe them in attention: ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily the thing it ſelfe ſpeaketh that in this Heavenly Interlude, by diverſe <hi>ſhewes</hi> and <hi>apparitions</hi> are repreſented diverſe, or rather (as we ſhall ſee) the ſame things touching the Church, not paſt, but to come, and that their diverſe <hi>Acts</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by diverſe <hi>Chores</hi> or Companies, one while of 24. <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>four Beaſt,</hi> another while of <hi>Angels,</hi> ſometimes of <hi>Sealed ones in their foreheads,</hi> and ſometimes of <hi>Harpers,</hi> &amp;c. with <hi>new Songs,</hi> and worthy <hi>Hymmes,</hi> not ſo much to leſſen the weariſomneſſe of the Spectators, as to infuſe holy meditations into the mindes of the Readers, and to lift them up to Heavenly matters. The which thing not having been hitherto obſerved by moſt Interpreters, they have wondred what was meant by ſo many <hi>Songs, Hymmes,</hi> and change of Angels and Perſonages re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in diverſe Viſions, and what by the often iterated Repreſentations of the <hi>Beaſt, Babylon,</hi> and the <hi>last judgement,</hi> which cauſed them to ſeeke and imagine Anticipations, Recapitulations, and unneceſſary Myſteries in thoſe things, which either ſerved onely to the <hi>Dramaticall decorum,</hi> or elſe had a manifeſt reſpect to the method of the Viſions, concerning which I will ſpeak by and by.</p>

Yet I will ſay (to ſtir up the endeavours of others) as much as the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96676:13"/>Lord in mercy hath for the preſent revealed unto mee.</p>
               <p>It is now fiftie two yeers ago, ſince I firſt heard the <hi>Table-Propoſitions</hi> (as they call them) of my Maſter <hi>Zacharie <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſinus</hi> that great Divine, in <hi>Wiſedomes Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> out of the Old and New Teſtament.

At length Anno 1570. being again come (in courſe of reading of the Scriptures) unto the <hi>Revelation,</hi> he bade the <hi>Reader</hi> goe forward. Then the <hi>Revelation</hi> was read: which he illuſtrated with briefe notes, in ſo many dayes, yea halfe hours, as there are Chapters in the Booke, yet accurately, as hee was wont to doe all things: theſe his Obſervations I with all attention gave heed unto, and as much as might be, ſet them downe in writing, and thereby I began to obſerve ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the obſcurity about the diſtinction and analogie of the Viſions.</p>
               <p>Fourteene yeeres after I my ſelfe being called to the Government of the ſaid Colledge (wherein alſo I continued ſo many yeers) running over ſeven times at leaſt the explication of the Revelation, I at length ſeemed unto my ſelfe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſome kind of Harmony in certain <hi>Viſions,</hi> and as it were ſome diſtinct <hi>Acts</hi> of moſt of the Viſions.</p>
               <p>Here ſpecially of the Ancients <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and of the latter, <hi>Nicolaus Collado</hi> a Divine of <hi>Lauſanna,</hi> did moſt effect me.

               <p>For <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his Commentary de <hi>C. D.</hi> after hee had taught that the laſt judgement ſhould certainly come to paſſe, both by other Scriptures, and largely alſo by the Revelation, at length, he ſaith: <hi>In this Booke many things are obſcurely ſpoken, to exerciſe the mind of the Reader: and in it are a few things, by the manifeſtation whereof the rest might with labour bee found out: chiefly becauſe it ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peateth the ſame things after a diverſe manner, as if it ſeemed to ſpeake of different things, whereas wee ſhall finde that it ſpeakes of the very ſame things, after a diverſe manner.</hi> By which words <hi>Augustine</hi> ſeemeth to me wittily and truely to ſay three things. <hi>First,</hi> that many darke things are contained in this Booke, to exerciſe the minds of the Reader. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that ſome things in the Booke are plaine, by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding whereof, the other more obſcure things might with ſtudy be dived into. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that it principally conduceth unto the ſearching out of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of this Booke, to obſerve that the ſame things are ſpoken of in diverſe Types after a different manner, although different things ſeeme to bee ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> of which touching the obſcurity ſeemeth plainely ſo to be, as hath before been ſhewed in Chap. 3. by which indeed the Holy Ghoſt hath invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this Propheſie of the New Teſtament, not becauſe hee would not have the ſame to bee underſtood by the Readers: but to have their mindes and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding exerciſed with labour, ſtudie, and prayer: as appeareth Chap. 13.18. &amp; 17.9, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> doth notably reſpect the ſpeciall method.

For example: It is plaine that in the very beginning it is ſaid, that here thoſe things are revealed, <hi>which muſt ſhortly be done:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.1.19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 14.1 <hi>&amp;</hi> 15.1. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.14 <hi>&amp;</hi> 19.11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20.11.</note> and John is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to write thoſe things, <hi>which then were, and which ſhould afterward come to paſſe:</hi> and expreſly thoſe <hi>laſt plagues,</hi> and oftentimes the laſt Iudgement: whence two more darke things are eaſily dived into. <hi>Firſt,</hi> that the Types of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation do not repreſent the foregoing Hiſtorie of the Iſraelitiſh Church: but the future ſtate of the New Church. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that they ſhaddow out, not a few

               <p>Thus it is plaine, that the <hi>starres</hi> are the Miniſters of the Churches, the <hi>great ſtarres</hi> renowned Teachers. Whence it is not obſcure, what is meant by the great ſtarres falling from Heaven.</p>

                     <hi>Ezech:</hi> 16.2: <hi>Ier.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Oſe.</hi> 2.5.</note> that in Scripture a <hi>whoriſh woman</hi> doth denote the Apoſtaticall Church. Whence it is cleare, that the <hi>woman clothed with the Sun,</hi> ſignifies the true Church: the flight of the woman into the wilderneſſe, her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of ſight, <hi>riding on the Beaſt,</hi> and ſitting upon <hi>ſeven hils,</hi> the adulterous and domineering Church of Rome.</p>
               <p>It is alſo plaine, that moſt of the Viſions doe end with the laſt Iudgement. Hence it is manifeſt, that the periods of the Church are often ended: neither is one onely continued throughout the whole Revelation.</p>
               <p>Which very thing the Third Advertiſement of <hi>Auſtine</hi> doth intimate. For by the <hi>ſeven Seales</hi> and <hi>ſeven Trumpets</hi> different things ſeem to be ſignified, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the ſame things are treated of after a different manner. Thus the <hi>Beasts</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be diverſe, whereas notwithſtanding they are but one. The rupture, and ruine of <hi>Babylon</hi> is diverſly ſet forth: and yet it alwayes comes but to one thing.</p>
               <p>And this is that which alſo <hi>Nicolaus Collado</hi> ſeemes to have obſerved in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition on the Revelation in the School of Lauſanna, publiſhed Anno 1584. For following this obſervation of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> he learnedly ſheweth: that it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Lord to ſhew a thing unto his ſervants in Viſions, not once, but twice, yea ſometimes thrice, the more to confirme the thing: like as in Act. 10. when God would ſhew <hi>Peter,</hi> that he ſhould not refuſe to go in to a heathen man, it is ſaid that he ſaw a <hi>ſheet let downe thrice to the Earth from Heaven, and received up againe:</hi> ſo alſo in the Revelation the future calamities and changes of the Church are exhibited to <hi>Iohn</hi> not once, but againe and againe in diverſe Viſions: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in ſuch a manner, that by a certaine gradation, the latter doe alwayes adde ſomewhat more cleare and waighty to the former. Now that the matter may appeare more evidently, I will ſet down his own words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>After,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Method pag.</hi> 19:</note> ſaith he, <hi>horrible tyranny had oppreſſed even all the Churches, and that indeed with a wonderfull cloake of hid hypocriſie: and ſo all liberty was either extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, or baniſhed, or alſo more and more brought to nothing through contempt, or did weare away through neglect: Hoc opus hic labor erat: and therefore the Lord would have the ſervants of Chriſt to be forewarned of ſuch weighty matters in a threefold Viſion, leaſt through the vniverſall rage of wickedneſſe they might be drawne away, or least be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſometime drawne away, they ſhould never returne into the right way againe. This, I ſay, was chiefly the neceſſary cauſe of foreſignifying the ſame thing diverſly: and the often inculcating of it by ſeven Seales, ſeven Trumpets alſo, and ſeven Vials: Now in theſe is a certaine gradation most worthy of obſervation. For the opening of the ſeven Seales stirreth up indeed, and moveth the eyes of the Beholders a farre off: neither doth it ſuffer all the ſenſes to bee without a part: but the moſt ſhrill ſound of the Trumpets brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theth indeed ſomething more terrible, and ſounding in the eares of ſleepy and dull perſons, ſuffers them not to goe on in their ſluggiſh drowſineſſe. Yet theſe two may ſeeme onely to have respect to the eyes and eares: But the pouring forth of the Vials may bee ſaid wholly to take hold on the whole man, and with heat to ſcorch him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is alſo worthy of obſervation, that in this Booke are gathered together ſeven Viſions of three ſorts touching the ſame things,</hi> viz. <hi>of Seales, Trumpets, and Vials, ſo as every latter kinde is more full then the former, (which belongs alſo unto the Narration of things) and propounds the things themſelves more neerly to the view of the eye, denoting, and more certainly defining the ſame with more circumſtances. For example: the opening indeed of the Seales comprehends the whole matter, though ſummarily, yet ſignificantly enough: but all the ſame things much more ſignificantly in the ſounding of the Trumpets: but the pouring out of the vials comprehends theſe very things moſt ſignificantly of all. So in thoſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96676:14"/>Dreames of Ioſeph it is more expreſſe, that Ioſeph ſhould bee worſhipped by the Sunne, Moone, and eleven Starres, then that his ſheafe ſhould be worſhipped by his brethrens ſheaves. So in the Dreames of Pharaoh thoſe ſeven eares of corne did more neerly ſerve to ſignifie either fruitfulneſſe or dearth: then the ſeven kine. So alſo the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iſion reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the foure Monarchies in that Image, whoſe head was of gold, Dan.</hi> 2. <hi>and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing unto them the Kingdome of Chriſt, yet it leſſe expreſſeth the matter, then that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing viſion in Dan.</hi> 7. <hi>propounding the ſame things in foure Beaſts: alſo the viſion of part of thoſe very things in Chap.</hi> 8. <hi>is more plaine: and in the Ramme, He-goat, and his foure hornes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>againe ſpeciall particulars hee alſo proſecutes more ſpecially, Chap.</hi> 11. Theſe things COLLADO.</p>
               <p>Hence he after a new manner hath faſhioned his method into the forme of an Harmonie, oppoſitely coupling the ſeven Seales of the ſecond Viſion, with the ſeven Trumpets of the third Viſion, and with the ſeven Vials of the fift Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by a ſingular ſtudie and praiſe-worthy diligence.</p>
               <p>Now although I do not at this time diſpute of his explication it ſelfe:

                  </note> and that the combining of the ſeven Vials with the ſeven Seales and Trumpets, is not without ſcruple, as I ſhall ſhew in its place: as alſo that he reſtraines the whole <hi>Revelation</hi> unto the Tragedie of Antichriſt, or thoſe times onely which after the riſing and growth of Antichriſt felt the calamities ſhadowed out: nor laſtly doth it from that combination or coupling ſufficiently appeare, what is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of many other wonders touching the meaſuring of the Temple, and the <hi>two witneſſes</hi> ſlaine by the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> of the travaile and flight of the woman into the wilderneſſe: of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> four times comming forth on the Theater,

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ials:</hi> Notwithſtanding I hence have drawn two things which are ſufficiently evident: <hi>Firſt</hi> indeed, that they do erre from the ſcope, who with <hi>Lyranus, Antoninus,</hi> and others, imagine that a continued courſe of the Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtorie, from the beginning of the Revelation unto the end of the world is praefigured in this Propheſie: Unto which opinion, beſides thoſe things <hi>Collado</hi> hath noted, this in ſpeciall is contradictorie, that almoſt in every of the Viſions, the whole period is ſo evidently ended by the Type of the laſt Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as it cannot eaſily bee quaeſtioned, or weakened by imagined Anticipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that of <hi>Auſtin</hi> in the fore-alledged place: <hi>The Revelation doth ſo repeat the ſame things many wayes, as it may ſeeme to ſpeake of different things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is found to ſpeake the ſame things onely in a diverſe manner:</hi> that is, it repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the future condition of the Church, ſo farre as it concerneth the principall events, by diverſe Viſions againe and againe, one while more obſcurely, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while more plainly.</p>
               <p>Hence briefly I thus determine touching the generall <hi>Method</hi> of the whole Propheſie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> that wee ſtray not from the ſcope, we muſt know, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> that the <hi>Revelation</hi> is not a repreſentation of things paſt, like as, for example, the Hiſtorie of <hi>Daniel,
<note place="margin">That things paſt are not repreſented.</note> Suſanna,</hi> or the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> is repreſented in a Comoedie, as <hi>Alcaſar</hi> affirmeth, but that it is a Propheſie of future events concerning the Chriſtian Church, even from the time of the <hi>Revelation</hi> (which, as before I ſhewed, was about the 14. yeer of <hi>Domitian,</hi> or the ninety ſixth of Chriſt) unto the laſt deliverance of the Church, and utter deſtruction of Antichriſt with all the wicked. For therefore it is called a <hi>Revelation</hi> and a <hi>Propheſie,</hi> which is onely of future things: and Chriſt commands John to write thoſe things <hi>which must be done afterward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The which notwithſtanding is not to bee taken ſo preciſely, as if there were nothing at all of things paſt intermingled. For almoſt in three places, the argument of the Viſions ſo requiring, it could not be avoided, but ſome things paſt ſhould be mixed with things to come. The <hi>firſt place</hi> is in Chap. 12. tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the woman in travaile with the Man-Child, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or originall of the Chriſtian Church is plainly figured out by the Type of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96676:15"/>Chriſts Nativity and Aſcenſion: which Viſion therefore is more perfect then all the reſt, as we ſhall ſee in its place. The <hi>ſecond place</hi> is in Chap. 17. where the Beaſt, on which the whore ſitteth, is ſaid to have been in the <hi>five Kings</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Revelation. <hi>Laſtly</hi> in Chap. 20. touching the thouſand yeers of Satans binding, that he might no more ſeduce the Nations, a few yeers, to wit, twenty five, from the deſtruction of the Temple and Iewiſh Nation went before the Revelation: for Satan did not ceaſe through the Iewes to deceive the Nations, and keepe them from the Goſpell of Chriſt untill the Synagogue and the Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Nation was diſſipated: as ſhall be ſhewed in its place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi> we muſt remember: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> That howſoever the Revelation may ſeeme to be one continued <hi>Viſion:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is not one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued viſion but diſtinct</note> yet indeed it is not one, neither revealed at one time, but are many diſtinct Viſions, to wit, <hi>Seven,</hi> as it were ſo many <hi>ſights</hi> exhibited to Iohn in the Spirit, as was erewhile ſhewed in the Partition of the Booke: in which leaſt I ſhould goe too farre from other Interpreters, I retained the <hi>ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold number,</hi> which is familiar, and as it were peculiar unto this Propheſie: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have I varied ſave onely in the <hi>ſeventh Viſion,</hi> to which why I rather joyned the twentieth Chapter, then to the ſixt, I will ſhew hereafter.</p>
               <p>Evident traces of <hi>distinction</hi> do ſufficiently appear throughout in the Text, as ſhall be ſhewed Chap. 1.10. whither Iohn ſaw them in ſeven times and <hi>ecſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,</hi> or in fewer. This is certaine, that hee was not once onely, but oftentimes <hi>raviſhed in the Spirit,</hi> neither ſaw he all in one place, but ſomethings in <hi>Patmos,</hi> ſomethings in <hi>Heaven,</hi> ſomethings at the <hi>Sea-ſhoare,</hi> ſomethings <hi>in the Wilderneſſe,</hi> and laſtly ſomethings <hi>in a high mountain,</hi> which is to be obſerved partly againſt the new faigned conſequence of the <hi>Inquirer,</hi> partly againſt that received errour, as if one continuall Hiſtorie of the Church, from the beginning even unto the end were obſerved in this Booke: from which ſuppoſition many things will neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry be confuſedly explicated, and contrary to the ſcope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi> it is to be noted, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> what <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath obſerved, <hi>That the Revelation ſpeaks the ſame things after a diverſe manner,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ſaith the ſame things in a diverſe manner.</note> that is, that divers Viſions by changed types do repreſent the ſame period of the Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory. Of which thing that often iterated deſcription of the laſt Iudgement is a moſt cleare Argument, which is annexed unto every one of the <hi>Viſions,</hi> not by <hi>anticipation</hi> (as commonly it is imagined) but in a right order of Hiſtorie. Now leaſt this ſo often repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the ſame things, might bee thought to bee idle or unprofitable, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing obſervations are to be added.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly</hi> therefore it is to be noted, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> the ſame things are ſo diverſly ſpoken, as (which <hi>Collado</hi> hath well obſerved) the former Viſions are for the moſt part more obſcure,
<note place="margin">The latter Viſions are clearer then the former.</note> the latter bring clearer light to the darkeneſſe of the former, if you rightly obſerve them. The opening of the <hi>ſeven Seales</hi> ſeem to be obſcure in the <hi>ſecond Viſion:</hi> But the <hi>ſeven Trumpets,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>five</hi> latter, touching the <hi>great ſtars falling from Heaven to the Earth:</hi> the <hi>Locuſts</hi> tormenting, and yet not killing men, the Armies of the <hi>foure Angels of Euphrates,</hi> &amp;c. are more cleare in the <hi>third Viſion.</hi> The <hi>meaſuring of the Temple,</hi> and the Propheſie of the <hi>two Witneſſes</hi> ſeems to be obſcure, in the <hi>third Viſion:</hi> but it is illuſtrated by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the <hi>three Angels</hi> againſt Antichriſt, in the <hi>fourth viſion.</hi> The Hiſtorie of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> is obſcure Chap. 11. &amp; 13. but moſt cleare, Chap. 17. The laſt Judgement is more darkely ſhadowed out towards the end of the <hi>ſecond</hi> and <hi>third Viſions:</hi> but more clearely towards the end of the <hi>fourth,</hi> by the Type of the <hi>Harveſt</hi> and <hi>Vintage,</hi> and of the <hi>fift Viſion</hi> by the Type of a great <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake:</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> but moſt clearely towards the end of the <hi>ſixth:</hi> and moſt properly in the <hi>ſeventh.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The periods of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are the ſame, but not the ſame hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fiftly</hi> it is to be noted, that the ſame things are diverſly ſpoken, not becauſe the ſame individuall events are again iterated, but becauſe the ſelfe ſame period of the Church according to different Hiſtories more known, &amp; ſometimes alſo the ſame are ſhadowed out by more manifeſt Types. For example: <hi>In the ſecond viſion</hi> the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96676:15"/>
                  <hi>blacke-horſe</hi> denotes the Church made black with hereſies after <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time: The pale-horſe having death fitting on, and drawing Hell after him, the Church ſicke even unto death, towards Antichriſts riſing: <hi>In the third viſion</hi> by the ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the <hi>third, fourth,</hi> and <hi>fift Trumpets</hi> the ſame ſtate of the Church is indeed repreſented: yet more ſpecially the declining, corruption, and laſtly the apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the <hi>Sea of Rome: In the fourth viſion</hi> her Tyranny and Idolatry: <hi>In the fift and ſixt viſion</hi> is exhibited her ruine and judgement: and ſo of the reſt, as we ſhal ſee in the Expoſition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixtly,</hi> Alſo it is to be noted, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> that all the <hi>viſions</hi> doe figure out the ſame pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of the Church, yet not all the whole: but ſome indeed the whole,
<note place="margin">The peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od of the church is not whole in all the viſions.</note> others ſome certaine diſtances: For the whole period of the Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtorie from the Revelation unto the end, is principally diſtinguiſhed by <hi>foure diſtances:</hi> afterward I call them <hi>foure periods</hi> in the ſame ſenſe, for, the four remarkeable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances or ſtate of the whole period.
<note place="margin">There are four diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the period of Chriſts Church.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt <hi>distance</hi> was of the Church flouriſhing and groaning under the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Tyrants, untill the peace brought in by <hi>Conſtantine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond diſtance was of the Church reigning and rioting under Chriſtian Emperours, untill the riſing of the Weſterne Antichriſt in <hi>Boniface</hi> III. Pope of Rome: and of the Eaſterne in <hi>Mahumet</hi> ſixe yeers after: Of which diſtance HIEROM, <hi>after,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Church came under Chriſtian Princes:

               </p>
               <p>The third diſtance was of the Church troaden upon, and oppreſſed by Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, eſpecially the Weſterne, untill the <hi>meaſuring of the Temple,</hi> which began to be effected by the <hi>two witneſſes</hi> JOHN Husse, and JEROM OF PRAGUE, who were ſlaine by the <hi>Beaſt</hi> in the Councell of <hi>Conſtans</hi> Anno. 1414. and thence untill <hi>Luther,</hi> by whoſe miniſterie the meaſuring of the Temple (bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, or hindred through the Tyranny of Popes) began to bee continued Anno. 1517.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly the fourth</hi> diſtance is of the church reformed from Popery, &amp; of the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Papacy, to endure untill the end. For the <hi>Beaſt</hi> goes into deſtruction, whatſoever the gates of hel attempt to the contrarie,

               </p>
               <p>This whole period, I ſay, of the Chriſtian Church, ſome <hi>viſions</hi> doe repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, according to the foure-fold ſtate erewhile declared: and theſe I call UNI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERSAL Viſions, becauſe they containe the univerſall Hiſtorie of the Church: but ſome ſhadow out not the entire,
<note place="margin">Vniverſall viſions.</note> but onely the two latter diſtances of the whole period, or the Tragedie of Antichriſt: and theſe I call PARTICULAR, becauſe they praefigure not the whole Hiſtorie of the Church,
<note place="margin">Particular viſions.</note> but onely the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part thereof touching Antichriſts rage and judgement, and of the Churches warfare and victory againſt him.</p>
               <p>UNIVERSAL Viſions I find to bee foure: <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>ſecond</hi> touching the <hi>ſeven Seales:</hi> and the <hi>third</hi> of the <hi>ſeven Trumpets:</hi> and the <hi>fourth</hi> of the <hi>woman in travaile:</hi> and the <hi>ſeventh</hi> (which is as it were a Recapitulation of all the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) touching the binding and looſing of the <hi>Dragon,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>
                  <hi>Propheticall,</hi> I call thoſe Parts or Types of Viſions, which by word, geſture or action, repreſent future events concerning the Church, by a certaine ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of things, whither open or hid: and for the moſt part are repeated out of the Acts of the ancient Prophets: In the underſtanding and application of which unto their events paſt, preſent, and to come, the true explication of this Propheſie doth conſiſt, and principally aime at.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> The Method and Explication of the Propheticall Types, cannot be gathered more commodiouſly and ſafely then from the Argument it ſelfe, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>generall</hi> of the whole Booke,
<note place="margin">The diſtinct Acts of the viſions.</note> and the <hi>speciall</hi> of the Viſions in particular. The <hi>generall</hi> Argument (as we heard in the foregoing Chapter) is ſpecially in two things. For the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> forewarneth the Church of her condition and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes at hand: and armes her with comfort againſt the ſame. The ſame wee have in every of the Viſions. For they both foretell future evils, as alſo ſhew the Godly the remedies thereof: yet all ſhew not the ſame things, nor in the ſame manner. For ſome praefigure <hi>All,</hi> that is, both the firſt, and the ſecond Battles, which I called VNIVERSAL: ſome the ſecond onely and latter, which I called PARTICULAR.
<note place="margin">The former and latter battles of the church.</note> By the <hi>firſt</hi> or <hi>former</hi> battles of the Church, I mean, the Combats ſhee had with Tyrants and Romane Adverſaries, oppugning the Teſtimony of Jeſus: as alſo with Heretickes diverſly depraving the word of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96676:16"/>God. By the <hi>ſecond</hi> and <hi>later,</hi> her Combates with the Eaſterne and Weſterne Antichriſts.</p>
               <p>Hence there are as it were <hi>foure</hi> diſtinct ſcopes of the <hi>univerſall</hi> Viſions:
<note place="margin">The foure Acts of the univerſall Viſions.</note> but of the <hi>Particular</hi> two onely: the which I for inſtruction ſake do name <hi>Acts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The first</hi> Act of the <hi>univerſall</hi> Viſions hath a propoſition of the calamities, with which the Church ſhall bee aſſaulted by Pagans and Heretickes untill Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts riſing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond</hi> in way of parallell to the firſt, praefigureth comforts oppoſite to the calamities of the Godly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third</hi> ſhadoweth out an amplification of calamities, or new and more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Combats of the Church under Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>the fourth</hi> parallell to the third, ſheweth the <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> of all evils, <hi>viz.</hi> the declining of Antichriſts Kingdom, and the caſting of all adverſaries in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the lake of fire: and on the contrary the Churches Victory, and Eternall Glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The particular</hi> Viſions are finiſhed with the two latter Acts,
<note place="margin">The two Acts of the particular Viſions.</note> becauſe they one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſent Antichriſts tragedie, rage, declining, and deſtruction: the which notwithſtanding the former touching the <hi>ſeven <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ials</hi> doth more briefly: the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter touching the whore riding on the Beaſt more largely and clearly: therefore this alſo is to be diſtinguiſhed into <hi>foure Acts,</hi> yet anſwering to the two latter Acts of the <hi>univerſall</hi> Viſions.</p>
               <p>Now although the <hi>Parallell-Acts</hi> both former and latter are not alwayes divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by whole Chapters (like as Tragedie-writers uſe to doe) but ſometimes are joyned together, and as it were mingled in the ſame Chapters, becauſe they ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow out Hiſtories or things by the ſame periods, and walking (as the ſaying is) with equall ſteps: yet every where (if thou well obſerve the Method) they have traces evident enough, as wee have diligently ſhewed in every of the Viſions: where alſo wee have noted the Markes and Periods of every of them.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER. XI. <hi>The manner of interpreting obſerved by</hi> PAREUS.</head>
               <p>FVrthermore by the things hitherto ſpoken touching the Argument and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, the manner of interpreting obſerved by us will not be obſcure.</p>
               <p>To every <hi>viſion</hi> wee have praefixed its proper diſpenſation or order, with as much brevity, and light as could be: the Chapters we have illuſtrated with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, Parts, and Analyſis.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Doctrines</hi> which in this Propheſie are many and excellent: we have ſo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to expound and applie unto the Scope of divine Scriptures ſhewed by the Apoſtle: Rom. 15.4. 2. Tim. 3.16. (being profitable, for reproofe, for correction, for inſtruction in righteouſneſſe, and laſtly for the patience, comfort, and hope of the Saints) that this Booke may with no great labour, profitablie be propounded unto the Churches by the Miniſters of Gods word.</p>
               <p>Now ſeeing in the beginning I ſaid, that the eternall Deity of Chriſt is thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out in this Propheſie proved with ſuch evident Arguments againſt Heretickes, as ſcarcely any other Scripture doth it more clearely, I thought it worth the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to note above XL. Arguments of that nature in their ſeverall places, vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating them from the depravings of <hi>Eniedinus</hi> the <hi>Transſilvanian</hi> Hereticke (which he cals <hi>Explications:</hi>) that it might ſo much the more appeare, that thoſe Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, who (as <hi>Euſebius</hi> recordeth) denyed the Canonicall Authority of this Book, as not written by the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> but the Hereticke <hi>Cerinthus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>hiſt. cap.</hi> 25.</note> did either not looke into the Booke, and ſo ſinned through groſſe ignorance, or elſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:96676:17"/>were carried away with more then humane affection.</p>
               <p>What Method I have taken in explicating <hi>Propheticall</hi> things, hath already been ſaid, and the Praefaces of the Viſions ſhall ſhew: in which I have not onely laboured to declare the Argument, Scope, Coherence, Order, and Period of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, but in ſpeciall clearly to ſhew the Harmonie and conſent of the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and following Types, and of the darker and more clear each with other, and with the Types and Phraſes of the ancient Prophets, that ſo I might illuſtrate the Revelation by the Revelation:
<note place="margin">It is most ſafe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the Revelation by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</note> which manner of interpreting cannot bee but moſt ſafe and certaine. For ſeeing it is evident, that the darker Types go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and the clearer follow after, and are notwithſtanding Analogicall or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with each other: undoubtedly the more darke muſt bee ſought out by the clearer. Now the more cleare have no extraordinary difficult application unto the things ſignified by them: And therefore wee may thence with ſome labour draw the underſtanding of the darker, which alſo I have labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to doe.</p>
               <p>In ſumme (following <hi>Auſtines</hi> advice) I have ſhewed theſe two things: <hi>that the ſame things are ſo many wayes repeated in this Booke, as it may ſeeme to ſpeake of different things, whereas we ſhall finde that the ſame things are diverſly related:</hi> And: <hi>that a few</hi> (yea not a few but many) <hi>things are in the Booke,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aug. lib.</hi> 20. <hi>de</hi> C. <hi>D. cap.</hi> 17.</note> by the manifeſtation whereof the reſt might with labour be found out:</hi> which again I ſay not, as if I thought that all the myſteries of the Revelation were by me unfolded: Far be it: I come ſhort in many things. Throughout where I ſticke, and where bounds ſeeme to be ſet,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.7.</note> there I ingenuouſly profeſſe a man muſt ſtand and goe no further. For here is wiſedome.
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8</note> To them that earneſtly call upon God the Spirit is given <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſure of the gift of Christ.</hi> It befell even the Apoſtle Paul, that he obtained not the thing hee petioned of God. How much more may the ſame befall us, and me the leaſt of all: eſpecially in theſe things, of which the Lord hath as yet reſerved much in his owne power.</p>
               <p>Wherefore to interpret the Revelation,
<note place="margin">What it is to interpret the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</note> is not to untie all the knots of Aenig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maes, to leave unſifted or be ignorant of nothing at all in the ſame, or by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely interpreting the meaning of the <hi>Image, Character, number of the Beaſts name,</hi> the <hi>Beast</hi> himſelfe, <hi>the woman on the Beaſt,</hi> the <hi>eating of her fleſh,</hi> the <hi>ſeven,</hi> the <hi>ten Kings</hi> that ſhall burne her, <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> to make all gain-ſayers to bee ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. For who hath ever attained unto this by interpretation or commenting on any part of Holy Writ? They therefore that require the ſame, are wiſer then Chriſt, the Apoſtles and God himſelfe: And on the contrary ſuch are wiſe againſt God who make a mocke of the Oracles they underſtand not, becauſe of their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, or becauſe of the diverſity of Interpreters.</p>
               <p>Many types of future things remaine ſecret and are known to God onely, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they be fulfilled. The whole <hi>fourth Act</hi> with its accompliſhment is ſecret: becauſe the <hi>ſeventh Trumpet</hi> hath not yet ſounded: neither is the <hi>ſeventh Viall</hi> yet poured forth into the Ayre. A great part alſo of the <hi>third Act</hi> is reſerved unto poſteritie, which in time ſhall ſee the full gathering together of <hi>the Kings of the Earth into Harmageddon,</hi> the devouring and burning of the whoriſh woman, the deſolation of Babylon, and the event of the <hi>Goggiſh Warre,</hi> &amp;c. The beginning we ſee, and further ſhall ſee.</p>
               <p>In the two former <hi>Acts,</hi> and the better part of the third (the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof hitherto Hiſtories and dayly experience do ſo plainly ſhew, that if we held our peace, the very ſtones would cry out) it is the part of a Faithfull Interpreter, not to draw the Readers from the ſcope, neither to ſend them from thoſe things which are done at home before their eyes, to ſeek for <hi>Chymeras</hi> in the <hi>Hyperborean</hi> Mountaines, which thing almoſt all the Ieſuiticall brethren at this day do in their Commentaries, leaſt happily Antichriſt ſhould bee found in the <hi>Mountaines of Rome,</hi> for the diſcovery of whom the greater part of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalyps was of old revealed, and circumſcribed with ſuch apparent oracles, that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96676:17"/>after the Hiſtorie and experience of ſo many Ages, we may juſtly queſtion, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were greater blindneſſe in the Jews not to beleeve in Chriſt, then for theſe to deny the Pope of Rome to be Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I ſhall ſeeme to have performed my function ſufficiently, not if I diſcuſſe all the obſcurities of myſteries ſo irreſutably, that all do applaude mee: but if (ſo farre as God hath enabled me) by the helpe of my Method laid down, I ſhall congruouſly, perſpicuouſly, and without deceit (according to ſcope and experience) explicate both the other Aenigmaes of this Propheſie, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that part which containes the amplification and <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> of the Combats of the Church, and properly reſpects theſe laſt times. Now by doing hereof, if I have not kindled a Torch, to take off the darkeneſſe with which it ſeemes to be covered, yet verily I have laboured, and if I be not deceived, have lighted a Candle, by the light and guidance whereof, as by <hi>Ariadne</hi> her threed, other (<gap reason="foreign">

For it is not man, but God, who foreſeeth, and revealeth things to come. But the events which were to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall the Church under the new Teſtament were hidde both from Iohn, and us, but are revealed in this booke: and therefore it is rightly called <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, that is, a revelation of things to come. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward it is ſometimes called a prophefie, from the argument of it, which is a prediction of future things revealed by God. And the title anſwereth to the title of the ancient prophets, as, <hi>the viſion of Iſaiah, the viſion of Obadiah, the propheſie of Niniveh, which Naum ſaw, the propheſie which Habacucſaw, the word of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For as Ierom wel obſerveth, this myſtical booke is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, a revelation, to give us to underſtand, that we have need of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and explanation of it, that wee may ſay with the prophet, <hi>open my eyes, and I will conſider the marveillous things of thy law Pſal.</hi> 119.18.</p>

                           </gap> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the deity of Chriſt.</note> So that Chriſt is the author of the revelation, which is the firſt argument to proove the God-head of Chriſt, in this booke. For God, by the prophet, doth aſſume it as a thing peculiar to himſelf, to reveal ſecrets. Iſai. 42, 9, &amp; 41, 23: <hi>Behold, the former things are come to paſſe, and new things doe I declare, before they ſpring forth I will tell you of them:</hi> and confounds by this argument all Idols, that they are no Gods, becauſe they are ignorant of future things. But the words following, <hi>which God gave unto him,</hi> ſeem to weaken the argument. For to whom God doth reveal things to come, hee is not God: but God hath revealed theſe things to Chriſt, therefore Chriſt is not God. The anſwer is twofold, firſt the whole may bee granted, if it bee taken in a good ſence, as namely, that Chriſt (albeit he is true God) yet wherein God his father hath revealed theſe things to him, that is, according to his humanitie, hee is not God. For the humanitie of Chriſt, not foreknowing things to come but by revelation, is not God: but the man Chriſt Ieſus, is God, becauſe by his divinitie, hee fore knoweth all things of himſelf, Secondly the aſſumption is not in the text, and may bee denyed: for Iohn ſaith not, that God revealed theſe things to Chriſt, but gave this revelation to him, as to our mediator, that hee might reveal the ſame
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96676:24"/>to us his ſervants: for it is his proper office, to reveal the will of the father to the Church. So that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But Thirdly, there follows no abſurditie, to underſtand it as ſpoken of the Godhead of Chriſt: for ſuch as is the order of exiſtence, ſuch alſo is the manner of working, betwixt the father, and the ſonn. For as the ſomexiſteth not of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but as hee is the firſt begotten of the father, ſo the ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> revealeth things to come, not of himſelf, but as hee receiveth from the father: and as the father Giveth unto the ſon his Eſſence: ſo is alſo his divine wildome communicated unto him from the father by Eternall Generation. Lyra and others underſtand <hi>God,</hi> in this place (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) Eſſentially of the whole trinitie: and taking it in that ſence, then the revelation is given to Chriſt by God, as unto a mediator onely, but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it of the perſon of the father, then God is ſaid to give it unto Chriſt both, as to the ſonn, and mediator alſo.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To ſhew unto his ſervants)</hi> the end, that God Gave the revelation to Chriſt, was, not that hee ſhould have it for himſelf. But, as being the meſſenger of the father, to reveal it to his ſervants. By <hi>ſervants</hi> is meant Iohn, with the paſtors and teachers, yea all the faithfull of all ages: to all which the myſteries of this booke were to bee revealed by Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, to Iohn that hee ſhould write it, and then to all the reſt both to read, and underſtand it, meditate, teach, &amp; explain it to the Church of God. The Gr. (<gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>) <hi>to ſhew,</hi> which noteth the office of Chriſt, and not of God. So that Chriſt ſheweth this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,

                        </note> to his owne ſervants, which is a ſecond argument; proving the Godhead of Chriſt. For hee certainly is the Lord of the Church, yea God Eternal, to whom Iohn, the teachers, and all the faithfull of the Church are ſervants: for God alone is the Lord of the Church, according to that of the pſalmiſt, <hi>Iehovah our Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 8.10. For albeit Chriſt in that hee is our mediator, is exalted to bee head, and Lord of the Church: notwithſtanding (except hee had been God) hee could neither have been mediator, or Lord of the Church. So that we plainly ſee, that Chriſt Jeſus, is God, ſeeing John and all the faithfull are his ſervants.</p>

                     <p>For the firſt perſecution of Chriſtians, began ſtraightways under Tiberius and Nero, which tooke away Paul, and Peter: the other under Domitian, in whoſe time Iohn was baniſhed. Wherefore hee foretels them, not to terrify, but to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the godly againſt the dangers at hand, that it might not come upon them unawares: as Chriſt ſaith Iohn 16, 1: <hi>theſe things have I ſpoken unto you, that ye ſhould not bee offended:</hi> for the darts which are foreſeen, are the leſſe hurtfull: withall hee teacheth, what is the portion of the Church in this world: namely to ſuffer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, leaſt wee ſhould fayn delights unto our ſelves. So likewiſe hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth us from the brevitie of the afflictions, and certainty of the promiſed deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance: For as afflictions muſt ſhortly come, ſo alſo ſhall deliverance ſhortly, and certainly come: becauſe Chriſt foretold the one, as wel as the other unto Iohn.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly it appeareth that the revelation treateth, not of things paſt but to come: wherefore they miſſe of the ſcope, who apply a great part of the types to the ſtate of the Iewiſh occurrences and Roman Empire then allready paſt.</p>

                     </p>

Neither is that equivocation of Andreas to be allowed, who ſaith, the <hi>ſeven ſpirits are not, as equall in power, joyned with the moſt hie God, and bleſſed trinity: But are named, onely, as Gods chiefe ſervants, according to that of the Apoſtle, I charge thee before God,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.21.</note> and the Lord Ieſus Christ, and the elect angels.</hi> But the particle <hi>(from)</hi> three times repeated, doth plainly ſhew, that the ſeven ſpirits are joyned with God, as the giver of Grace. Whereas to call God, Chriſt, the angels and man together to witnes, is neither repugnant to ſcripture or ſound divinity: For Chriſt himſelf, ch. 3.5. ſaith, <hi>I will confeſſe his name, before my father, and before his angels.</hi> And therefore that place in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.21: alleaged by <hi>Andreas,</hi> is not of the ſame nature, with this here treated of. For the literall ſence ſeemeth not fully to agree with the following places, (as I my ſelf have formerly minded) neither to confirme ought to angels as by and by I will it make to appear.</p>

The conſideration of whoſe love ought to take away from us all opinion of merit, and ſelfe-truſt.

                        <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7: <hi>Behold he commeth with clouds, and every eye ſhall ſee him</hi>] This confirmeth the former argument, that theſe things are certainly ſpoken of Chriſt: ſeeing it is hee which muſt come to judgement, it is hee whom every eye ſhall ſee to come in the clouds of heaven with power and majeſtie, it is hee, whom the ſoldiers pierced, and at whoſe comming all the kinreds of the earth ſhal waile, and the wicked ſhall <hi>cry, ſaying to the mountains fall on us, &amp; to the hills cover us.</hi>

But ſome may ſay, why is there here a promiſe of his comming? not onely to ſtrengthen our faith touching his glorious returning to judgement, but chiefly for the comfort of the godly, and terrour of the wicked. For now Chriſt being bodily abſent, ſeemeth (as it were) to have forſaken the Church in her affliction: but our redeemer will <hi>come in the cloudes:</hi> now the wicked rejoyce, tyrants tyranniſe, and Antichriſt rageth againſt the Godly, as if they were left orphants. But they ſhall ſee the judge comming gloriouſly in the cloudes, him (I ſay) whom they have injuriouſly condemned, pierced, and ſtill daily doe afflict in his poore members, yea and ſhall bitterly howl, when they ſhall hear that ſentence pronounced,

                        <hi>With cloudes</hi>] This is more, <hi>then in the cloudes,</hi> which is ſpoken of us: for wee at the comming of Chriſt <hi>ſhall be caught up in the cloudes to meete the Lord in the ayre.</hi>

<note place="margin">1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11, 26.</note> wee are commanded to ſhew forth his death <hi>till hee come.</hi> So then hee will come viſibly with the cloudes, the which is a ſtrong reaſon to prove that his body is not the mean time inviſibly hid in, under, or about their hoſt, altar, or chalice.</p>

                     <p>Firſt becauſe, it is not onely ſaid of Chriſt, that hee is to come, but of many others alſo, as Matth. 17.11: <hi>Elias must firſt come.</hi> God the father is ſaid to come, Matth. 21.40: <hi>When the Lord of the vineyard commeth, what wil be do to thoſe husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> Chriſt ſaith of himſelf and the father, Ioh. 14.23: <hi>We will come to him, and make our abode with him.</hi>

For the ſtrength of our argument ſtandeth not in this: <hi>viz. that every one, who is to come is God,</hi> (as the heretick fooliſhly imagineth) but thus, that he is God, to whom all theſe divine attributes doe appertain.</p>
                     <p>Secondly though that deſcription of God <hi>which is, &amp;c.</hi> do in verſ. 4: note out the perſon of the father, from whom <hi>John</hi> firſt of all deſireth <hi>grace:</hi> yet foraſmuch as the eſſential attributes, reſpecting eternity, are common to the three perſons, therefore they are rightly attributed to Chriſt the ſecond perſon in the trinity.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, howſoever we acknowledge, that the ſtile is propheticall, yet it will neceſſarily follow, that Chriſt here ſpeakes theſe things of himſelf, both to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme Iohns teſtimony of him, as alſo that the godly might be comforted in having ſo great, and glorious a judge. And laſtly it is for the the terror of all wicked and ungodly men. And thus much of the preface.</p>

I Iohn: Dionyſius Alexandrinus,</hi> as <hi>Euſebius</hi> witneſſeth, draweth hence a reaſon for to weaken the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of this booke, as if the author were exceſſive in publiſhing of his owne praiſe: for, ſaith he, <hi>the Prophets</hi> &amp; <hi>Apoſtles</hi> uſed not to mention ſo ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their owne names, as <hi>Iohn</hi> doth in this booke: ſaying many times <hi>J Iohn,</hi> as if he had been writing not a booke, but an obligation or acquittance. But Iohn herein doth nothing more, then what is very ſeemly, yea neceſſary. Five times indeed, he names himſelf in this booke, which wil not ſeeme ſtrange, if wee minde that it is one thing, to write a hiſtorie, another thing to write a propheſie. The truth of an <hi>hiſtorie</hi> requireth not the authority of the writer, but ſo doth a <hi>propheſie.</hi> Therefore we read that the old prophets as <hi>Jeremie, Daniel,</hi> and others did uſually prefix their names to their prophecies, whoſe example Iohn ſeemeth here to imitate. Yea Paul himſelf expreſſeth ſometime his name in his Epiſtles, <hi>I Paul with my owne hand, &amp;c.</hi> And touching the repetition of his name here, it was very neceſſarie. For otherwiſe it might have been thought, that Chriſt who before cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led himſelf <hi>Alpha and Omega,</hi> had alſo ſpoken the words following <hi>I am your</hi> brother, &amp;c. therefore his name is ſeaſonably inſerted, <hi>I John</hi> who am your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c. by which epithites, hee ſeekes to win their good wil, &amp; alſo comforteth the Churches to whom he writeth.</p>

                        <hi>Your brother</hi>] Not by blood, but by faith, and in the communion of Chriſt, for there is betwixt the members of Chriſt <hi>a ſpirituall brotherhood,</hi> ſtraightly tying them together in the bond of love: he calleth himſelf their <hi>companion</hi> in three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects: becauſe they who are the members of one head, muſt mutually partake to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in all conditions. Firſt in affliction, for even then the Chriſtians were grievouſly perſecuted under <hi>Domitian,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> himſelf baniſhed into Patmos.

Thirdly he was their <hi>companion in the patience of Jeſus Christ:</hi> or <hi>ſufferance,</hi> as the word import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ſhewing that in the kingdom to come we ſhall not ſuffer, but reigne, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that of Paul 2 Timoth.

It is further reported, that <hi>Domitian</hi> did caſt him into a caldron of boyling oyle, in way of ſcorne, becauſe he had heard, that the Chriſtians tooke their name from Chriſt, that is, the anointed. <hi>Domitian</hi> being ſlain, &amp; his acts for their cruelty recalled by the Senate, Iohn (under the Emperor <hi>Nerva</hi>) returned from his baniſhment to Epheſus, and miniſtred to the ſeven Churches in <hi>Aſia,</hi> to whom he wrote the firſt viſion. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> recordeth, that <hi>John</hi> was in <hi>Patmos</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Clandius Ceſar:</hi> But it is a manifeſt error, <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> being put for <hi>Domitian,</hi> as the computation of the time ſheweth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For the word of God</hi>] He cloſely notes the cauſe of his baniſhment, leaſt it might bee ſcandalous, and taken as if he had been there as a malefactor: (for not the puniſhment, but the cauſe maketh a martyr:) whereas it was for his conſtant profeſſion of the doctrine of Chriſt, which the Romans would neither ſuffer, in their city, or other territories, which cauſed the firſt great perſecution againſt the Chriſtians under <hi>Nero:</hi> and the ſecond under <hi>Domitian,</hi> at which time many thouſands of them laid downe their lives, for the cauſe of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For the word of God, and the testimonie of Ieſus Christ</hi>] Both are joyned, as here, ſo in verſ. 2. By the <hi>word,</hi> hee underſtandeth the <hi>ſon,</hi> the eſſentiall word of God, Ioh. 1.1: By the <hi>teſtimonie</hi> he meaneth the doctrine of Chriſt. Thus by baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſufferings, the primitive Chriſtians did triumph over their enemies, though ſcandaliſed as fooles and Galileans by the men of this world and eſteemed worthy of nothing, but whipping, torturing and hanging therefore (ſaith Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian) that <hi>which the enemies chalenge over us, is our joy: who had rather be candemned then forſake God: this is the Palme of our clothing: This is the Chariot of our triumph, and the reaſon why wee ſubmit not to theſe, whom thus we have overcome.</hi> Thus much for the time and the place, when, and where this propheſy was revealed to Iohn.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I was in the spirit</hi>] He ſheweth how he ſaw this revelation, <hi>viz.</hi> not with mortall eyes, but being raviſhed in ſpirit, his mind was carried beyond it ſelf. So we read that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> praying earneſtlie fell into a trance, and converſed with God.

For the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing viſions, and the myſteries of them were revealed unto Iohn, not by the power of any humane wit, but by the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>Interpreters obſerve three kinds of viſions. Firſt <hi>corporall,</hi> when we behold the objects preſerued, with our bodily eyes. Secondly <hi>spirituall,</hi> when we behold the appearances of things, either a wake, or a ſleepe, yet underſtand them not thus did <hi>Phurao, Nebuchadnezar, and Peter.</hi> The third they call <hi>intellectuall,</hi> that is, when the minde being illuminated by the holy Ghoſt underſtands the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of thoſe things which are preſented. Thus <hi>Ioſeph</hi> underſtood <hi>the viſion</hi> of <hi>Pharao,</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> that of <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> this <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw the viſions of the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation <hi>in the spirit,</hi> that is, the holy Ghoſt gave him to underſtand them. Others expound theſe words <hi>in the spirit,</hi> as oppoſite to the being preſent in the body, not as if ſuch which ſaw viſions in the ſpirit, did not ſtill retain their real bodies: but being raviſhed, they ſeemed for the preſent to themſelves, as out of the body even as <hi>Paul</hi> in the 2 Corinth. 12, 3: <hi>caught up to the third heaven, knew a man in Chriſt, whither in the body, or out of the body he knew not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This kind of viſions, is one of the gifts of the new Teſtament, which Chriſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending up on high poured forth upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church according to the oracle in <hi>Ioel.

                        <hi>On the Lords day</hi>] He calleth the firſt day of the weeke on which Chriſt roſe again, <hi>the Lords day.</hi> He ſaw the revelation, on this day, which Chriſtians kept holy to God, being by the authority of the Apoſtles ſet apart for Church meetings, in ſtead of the Iewiſh ſabbaths: as we way gather from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1: where the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle commandeth, that <hi>on the first day of the weeke, gathering be made in the Church, for the brethren in Iudea. So Acts</hi> 20.7. <hi>In one of the ſabbaths,</hi> that is, the firſt day of the weeke the Chriſtians are ſaid to come together to break bread.

                        </gap>, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſcandal, opinion of worſhip, and intruding upon the liberty, and conſcience: But the queſtion betwixt us, and the papiſts is, touching points of faith neceſſarie to ſalvation, which they affirme, that the Church or <hi>Biſhops</hi> may ordaine, without the authority of ſcripture, the which thing wee denie: <hi>For God is worſhiped in vain by the commandements of men:</hi> Beſides the authority of the Apoſtles is one thing, and the authority of Biſhops and the <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> is another. For they were not onely divinely inſpired in their writings, but alſo in whatſoever they inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted touching Church orders. Wherefore, they not onely appointed the <hi>Lords day</hi> to bee kept, but alſo made it apart of ſcripture: now as for other miniſters, they have not the ſame authority, ſo that, it cannot hence bee gathered, that any thing ſhould bee beleeved as neceſſarie to ſalvation, beſides what is contained in the holy ſcripture. For though the Lords day, is a matter not of faith: but of fact: yet the obſervation thereof is according to the word of God.</p>
                     <p>Here it may be demanded, whether <hi>John</hi> ſaw the whole <hi>revelation</hi> upon one Lords day? Indeed it may ſeem by the coherence of the matter, ſo to be: not withſtanding I thinke, that Chriſt did not at one time burden the minde of his ſervant, with ſo many different, and large viſions: neither is it probable, becauſe the like diſtinctions of time, which other prophets had in their viſions, appears alſo to be in theſe viſions of John: as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1, 2: is evident. <hi>After this I looked, &amp;c. and immediately</hi> I <hi>was in the ſpirit,</hi> ſo that after he had ſeene the firſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he was come to himſelf, ere he was again raviſhed, &amp; ſaw other viſions: and in like-lihood this was upon another <hi>Lords day.</hi> The like wee may gather from chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 17.3: <hi>So he carried mee away in the ſpirit, into the wilderneſſe:</hi> and often it is ſaid, <hi>after theſe things:</hi> But I doe not conceive all of them import a diſtance of time: but the things which I ſpecially minde are in: <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.2, <hi>and</hi> 17.3, <hi>and</hi> 21.1: beſides all things were not revealed to <hi>John</hi> in one place: but ſome things he ſaw in <hi>Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos,</hi> ſome in the heavens, ſome on the ſea ſhore, &amp; ſome things in the wilderneſſe: But ſeeing we cannot certainly determine of the thing, I will therefore leave it to the readers choiſe.</p>

In that hee heard the <hi>voice behinde him,</hi> is ſignified, that <hi>Iohn</hi> added nothing to theſe viſions, but that they were altogether divine for the things which are behind us we ſee not.

For both there and here he taketh the ſame things to himſelfe. And there is no queſtion to be made, but that in this place hee ſpeaketh himſelfe, and of himſelfe. <hi>Eniedinus the Samoſatenian</hi> objecteth, that theſe words are not in all copies, nor yet in the <hi>Latin verſion,</hi> and for this citeth the <hi>Annotations of Beza.</hi>

In theſe very words Chriſt ſpeaketh of himſelfe verſe. 17. and Chap. 21.6, &amp; 22 13: ſo that it ſeemeth, ſome hereticke adventured to blot this out of the vulgar verſion, thereby to darken the divinity of Chriſt, or els ſome preſumptuous perſon did it, who thought this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition needleſſe.</p>

Interpreters diſpute, who it was that appeared to <hi>Iohn,</hi> like unto the Son of man. Some take it indefinitely for any man: others for an angel, &amp; others for Chriſt: but the ſcope &amp; drift of the matter doth manifeſt, it was Chriſt that appeared in this likeneſſe, both becauſe he commandeth Iohn to write this revelation, verſ. 19: &amp; revealed the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing viſions <hi>to John, chap.</hi> 4.1, which onely Chriſt did: as alſo becauſe he is ſaid in verſ. 18 to have been dead, but is alive for evermore, &amp; hath <hi>the keyes of death &amp; hell:</hi> the which cannot be applied, neither to men nor Angels, but onely to Chriſt.

                     </p>
                     <p>This is for our comfort, wee may not thinke that wee are left of Chriſt, while wee are here in this troubleſome world: for he hath promiſed, <hi>that he will not leave us comfortleſſe,</hi> albeit wee ſee him not with our bodily eyes. Therefore beeing aſſured of his goodneſſe and power, let us not regard the threatnings, and cruelty of the adverſaries. It is alſo for our admonition, if Chriſt bee with us, let us then live holily, juſtly, and ſoberly in his ſight, leaſt he being offended at our ungodly walking, we provoke him thereby to wrath againſt us. For as hee is preſent for the ſafety of the godly, ſo alſo he will take vengeance on the wicked, and on ſuch as neglect their duty towards him: hence it is, that he comforteth ſome of thoſe Churches in the midſt of whom hee walketh, others he reprooveth, and threatneth to puniſh, if that they repent not. Their argument is fooliſh, who hence maintain the <hi>Vbiquity of the humanity of Christ. Chriſt</hi> (ſay they) <hi>ſtandeth in the midſt of the ſeven candleſticks. The humanity of Christ, is the ſon of man: therefore as man</hi> he is preſent in ſeven, that is, in all places.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer: the <hi>aſſumption</hi> is falſe. For the words, <hi>(ſon of man)</hi> ſignify not the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but perſon of Chriſt: wee confeſſe, and beleeve, that the perſon of the ſon of man, which is God, is every where. And in the midſt of two, or three, yea ſeven, and in all places: to wit, according to his divinity grace, and power, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaketh: though according to the fleſh, and the nature of a true body, he be in heaven, and there remaine untill from thence hee come to judgement, as the ſcriptures teſtifie: otherwiſe it would hence follow alſo, that the humanity of Chriſt, is <hi>Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending,</hi> that is eternal, becauſe the ſon of man ſpeaketh this of himſelf alſo.</p>
                     <p>Secondly though the <hi>aſſumption</hi> were granted, yet it will not follow, that the fleſh of Chriſt, is every where, but onely in ſeven places, and onely within, and not without the Church, which is contrarie to the opinion of the <hi>Vbiquitiſts</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                     <p>The contrarie followeth: for hee was ſeene of <hi>John.</hi> But what is infinite,

                        </gap>, that is, <hi>the incomprehenſible nature is not to be ſeene.</hi> In the laſt place no conſequences contrary to the analogie of faith, may be drawn from viſions: for ſo there would follow many abſurd things, as that the humanity of Chriſt ſhould have in his bodily hand, the <hi>ſeven angels, and Churches:</hi> and that a real ſword ſhould proceed out of his mouth, and the whole deſcription neceſſarily to be taken, according to the letter. The which if it were ſo, then Chriſt ſhould be no longer true man, who tooke our fleſh really of the virgin:
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5, 2. <hi>Philip.</hi> 3, 21.</note> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould he be our brother. For wee know, when he ſhall be revealed, we ſhall bee like unto him: but Chriſt at the day of judgement ſhall not appeare in ſuch a manner, neither ſhall we be thus like unto him: ſo that no concluſions contrary to the doctrin of faith, may be taken from allegories.</p>
                     <p>They are yet more fooliſh, which under the pretence of this viſion, labour to maintain the images of Chriſt, &amp; the ſaincts in temples, againſt the expreſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God: as if the ſon of man appeared to the end to be painted, and ſet up in ſuch a forme in temples, or thus painted to be ſent unto the Churches: and not rather to this end, that by theſe his admirable attributes, the divine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the following epiſtles might be confirmed, as by and by will appeare. Now let us conſider the deſcription. Firſt Iohn ſheweth the <hi>garments</hi> and <hi>habit</hi> wherein Chriſt appeareth.

According to that of <hi>Peter, Chriſt was mortifyed in the fleſh, but vivifyed in the spirit,</hi> that is, both dead in the fleſh, and alive in the ſpirit together. And this is the true meaning of that place, which is the ſame, with that common tenet, that Chriſt being dead in the fleſh, rayſed up himſelf, by the power of his divinity. This is alſo confirmed by the following words:</p>

                        <hi>Behold, I am alive for evermore</hi>] Hee ſaith not, and I lived again, but behold I <hi>am living,</hi> or <hi>alive:</hi> by the particle <hi>(behold,)</hi> hee attributes to himſelf an admirable, divine, and everlaſting life, to diſtinguiſh it from that life which he received again after his ſuffering in the fleſh.

                        <hi>Biſhops</hi>] So he caleth the ſtarres, becauſe they ought to ſhine before others in purity of doctrine, and integrity of life: like unto ſtarres ſhining in the firmament: they are ſaid to be <hi>angels,</hi> becauſe they are Gods meſſengers to the Churches: and the Churches are compared to candleſticks, becauſe like as the candle or light, is ſet up into the candleſtike: even ſo the Church ought to hold forth, and preſerve the ſhining light of true doctrine, that all may behold it, leaſt being in darkneſſe, they ſtumble and periſh thorow their ignorance.</p>
                     <p>Hence we learn in the firſt place, that the ſcripture beſt interpreteth it ſelf: for what was before more darkly ſpoken, is now clearly unfolded.

And the rock was Chriſt,</hi> for it ſignified Chriſt: as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> expoundeth it. For there is nothing more familiar in ſcripture, then to name ſignes, by the things which they ſignify, which maner of ſpeech is not darke, but plaine in regard of the analogie betwixt the ſigne, and the thing ſignified: wherefore it was not obſcure, but familiar to the ſcripture, that Chriſt called the bread which was broken at the inſtitution of the ſupper, <hi>his body which was crucifyed for us,</hi> ſeeing it was a ſacrament or holy ſigne of the ſame: Hence <hi>Auguſtine</hi> opening the <hi>etymologie</hi> or ſignification of a ſacrament, applies it to the Lords ſupper, ſaying, <hi>that the Lord Ieſus doubted not to ſay this is my body:</hi> when he gave the ſigne onely thereof.</p>
                     <p>And this is ſo cleare a truth, that even <hi>Aloaſar</hi> a Ieſuite confeſſeth it, ſaying, that <hi>in the phraſe of ſcripture touching dark ſentences, and ſacraments the word which is uſed, is to be referred to the ſignification of it, and that the bread and wine in the Euchariſt</hi> (which they call the ſpecies) <hi>doth ſignify the body and blood of Christ:</hi> becauſe Chriſt ſaith: <hi>this is my body, &amp;c.</hi> Indeed he ſuppoſeth there are two ſorts of ſignes: ſome inſtituted onely for doctrin and ſignification: as in parables, and darke ſentences: the other ſuch, as really include, and containe the things which they ſignifie: as in <hi>baptiſme,</hi> and the <hi>ſupper,</hi> in which (ſaith he) is truly and properly contained, as the cleanſing of the ſoule from ſinne: ſo the body and blood of Chriſt: and he proveth it: Firſt, becauſe Chriſt inſtituted theſe ſignes to that end: Secondly the Church ſo teacheth: And laſtly, becauſe it were an eaſy thing for any one to inſtitute meere, and naked ſignes: wheras it is in the power of Chriſt alone, to appoint ſuch ſignes as are full of efficacy.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer firſt:
<note place="margin">Alcaſars arguments anſwered.</note> that in the inſtitution either of baptiſme, or the Lords ſupper, there is no mention made of any including of the things ſignified in the ſignes.</p>
                     <p>Secondly the primitive Church taught no ſuch incluſion, but the new <hi>popiſh Church</hi> in ſo teaching is departed from the inſtitution, and doctrin of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly though it be true, that the ſacraments are not meere ſignes, yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not, that they are ſignes including the thing ſignified. For there is in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture another kinde of ſignes, which as they are ſignes, ſo they are ſeales confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the faithfull the grace of Chriſt ſignified by them: For properly the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are ſignes and ſeales of the promiſe of grace, which no creature could inſtitute, or bring into the Church, but God alone.</p>
                     <p>Another expoſitor denieth,

What then: <hi>the metaphor</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is in the ſubject, which doth not import that the copulative,</hi> IS <hi>ſhould be taken for the word</hi> ſignifieth. <hi>And though it were granted here, yet would it not follow, that the words of Chriſt at the inſtitution of the ſupper were of the ſame ſignificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe Chriſt did not expound to them a viſion, but inſtitute aſacrament.</hi> Now how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever both be true, yet doth not this take away the metonymical expreſſion; for in typical &amp; Sacramental aſſertions, the tipes &amp; ſignes are ſaid to be the antitypes, or things ſignified, partly indeed by a <hi>metaphor,</hi> becauſe of the analogie, or likeneſſe

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hriſt walking in the middeſt of the Candleſticks, delivers to Iohn the ſeven Epiſtles, to be ſent, to the ſeven miniſters of the Churches of Aſia, commanding him to commend the diligence of ſome, to reproove the negligence of others, and in the raſt place by promiſes and threatnings, to exhort all of them to their duty and conſtancy therein: ſo alſo he is commanded to write, <hi>thoſe things which he had ſeen, and which were; and which, ſhould come to paſſe,</hi> by which threefold diſtinction, Chriſt in the former Chapter declared in generall the arguments of theſe Epiſtles. For in commanding Iohn to write, <hi>thoſe things which he had ſeen,</hi> he was to declare the glorious viſion of Chriſt, unto the Churches, that ſo they might receive the writing with reverence and due reſpect. In bidding him to write, <hi>thoſe things which were,</hi> it ſhewes how he was to manifeſt the qualification of the Churches and Teachers; and whatſoever was either good, or evil in every one of them, that ſo they might perceive; how Chriſt our Lord taketh notice of all our actions. And laſtly, in bidding him to write, <hi>thoſe things which ſhould come after,</hi> Iohn was to propound to the godly a promiſed reward, and to the wicked judgement to come, that all might acknowledge Chriſt to be the glorious, juſt, and omnipotent judge of the world. But it is better to extend the three forenamed heads, to the whole revelation.</p>
               <p>To return to the Epiſtles, they are all exhortatory, and not much differing in matter one from the other. The ſixt to the Church of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> ſeemeth to be the excellenteſt, next to which is that unto <hi>Smyrna.</hi> But the ſeventh unto <hi>Laodicea,</hi> is the ſharpeſt. A common inſcription is prefixed before all, taken from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going glorious form of Chriſt: A generall Epiphonema is added in the concluſion provokeing them to attention by a ſpeciall promiſe; by which is underſtood, the end of that glorious, and magnificent apparition of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This Chapter doth contain the firſt fower Epiſtles; namely, to the paſtours of the Churches of <hi>Epheſus, Smyrna, Philadelphia,</hi> and <hi>Thiatyra.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Epiſtles.</note> And therefore the Chapter hath fower parts. The <hi>Analyſis</hi> of them all is plain, and almoſt one and the ſame. For they conſiſt of a Preface, Narration, Exhortation, and acclamation of promiſes annexed: or that I may ſpeak more plainly, they contain three things. Firſt, A deſcription of Chriſt the author of the Epiſtles. Secondly, The praiſe or diſpraiſe of each Angel. Thirdly, Good things are promiſed, to thoſe that overcome; and deſtruction to ſuch as fall away.</p>

<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Heb.</hi> 2, 14</note> It is the honour of the Angels, that they are <hi>miniſtring ſpirits ſent forth to miniſter for them, who ſhall be heires of falvation.</hi> Wherefore the Angels of Churches ought not to be puffed up becauſe of this dignity, but faithfully to demit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their paſtorall miniſtries. Moreover touching theſe Epiſtles, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne not the paſtors alone, but alſo (as appeareth by their concluſions) all the Churches, it being uſuall, that ſuch things as were to come to the whole, were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the paſtors, and by them afterwards to be brought unto the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Church of Epheſus</hi>] He is commanded in the firſt place to write to this Church, either, becauſe it lay neereſt <hi>Patmos,</hi> as <hi>Abraham Ortelius</hi> in his ancient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of <hi>Grecia</hi> ſheweth: or els for the eminency &amp; greatneſſe thereof, &amp; being better knowen unto Iohn then the reſt.
<note place="margin">Whither Timothy were then Biſhop of Epheſus</note> Hiſtories mention not, who at this time was the <hi>Angel</hi> of that church: not indeed doth Chriſt name him, to the end it might appear, that he had not reſpect ſo much to any one particular teacher, as to all others which ſhould ſucceed. Some thinke that it was <hi>Timothy,</hi> the diſciple of <hi>Paul;</hi> but it is not probable, that <hi>Timothie</hi> ſo much commended by <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtles, ſhould lye under ſo heavy a cenſure; beſides it is a received opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<note place="margin">Quandoque bonus dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitat Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merus.</note> that <hi>Timothie</hi> ſuffered martyrdome, before the time of Iohns exile.

Again it ſerves to ſtirre up all teachers to care, and vigilancy. But now whither the fault in this Biſhop (for which Chriſt threatneth deſtruction) be not mortal, but venial (as <hi>Aleaſar</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth) let himſelfe look to it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Write</hi>] Chriſt tels Iohn word for word what he ſhould write to the Churches: for he is the author of al theſe Epiſtles, and Iohn his penman or ſcribe. Which fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proveth the authority of this book: for without doubt after Chriſt had made an end of revealing the myſteries of this booke unto Iohn, he faithfully wrote to every one of the Churches according to the commandement of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Theſe things ſaith he that holdeth</hi>] The firſt Epiſtle hath three parts: namely, an <hi>inſcription,</hi> a <hi>narration, and a concluſion.</hi> In the <hi>inſcription</hi>
                        <pb n="31" facs="tcp:96676:40"/>Chriſt is brought in ſpeaking to the church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> by a deſcription of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon taken from the foregoing viſion; which ſerveth both for the authority of the Epiſtle, and to ſtirre them up unto attention. The manner of the ſtile is prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall. For ſo uſually the prophets in ſtirring up to attention bring God in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus to the people; <hi>thus ſaith Jehovah.</hi> So Iohn: <hi>theſe things ſaith hee that holdeth; &amp;c. not ſimply, theſe things ſaith Chriſt, but, theſe things ſaith he that holdeth the ſtarres, &amp;c.</hi> Thus by degrees two things are repeated, which he ſaw before. <hi>One</hi> of the ſtarres: <hi>another</hi> of the candleſticks.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Which holdeth the ſeven starres</hi>] That is, which holdeth <hi>the ſeven Paſtors of the Churches in his right hand, as chap.</hi> 1, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. This (as we have already ſhewed) may be taken either in the better part, that is, of Chriſts loving and caring for his faithfull teachers, his governing, and preſerving of them by the right hand of his power, with precious promiſed rewards. Or in a contrary ſence, it ſignifies, that Chriſt deteſteth, and by his right hand ſuppreſſeth, and rejecteth all ſlowbellies, hirelings and wolves; And ſo much here he threatneth to ſome of theſe teachers, unleſſe they did repent.</p>

For it is the part of him that is the admoniſher and judge, to pronounce ſentence of nothing, but what is well knowen unto him. He taketh unto himſelfe not onely the knowledge of what is outward, but alſo a cleare and perfect ſight of men, and all their inward actions, the which Iohn often in the Goſpel aſcribes unto Chriſt. <hi>He knew all men,

Before Chriſt ſaith, he could not beare, and here ſaith, he had borne: but there is no contradiction, for there he ſpake of his not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of impenitent ſinners in the Church: and here of his patient bearing of afflictions for the Goſpels ſake.</p>

And indeed it ſeemeth, that he began by little and little to be covetous, deſiring to heap up wealth, and ſo grew negligent of doing good to the ſtrangers and poore brethren; now <hi>covetouſnes is the roote of all evill,</hi> and moſt abominable in the teachers of the word; for it is one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall vertues in a Biſhop <hi>to be given to hospitality,</hi> and to be <hi>a lover of it.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1, 8.</note> And this ſeemeth to be the reaſon, wherefore the <hi>cannon law</hi> allowed to Biſhops one forth part of the Church revenues, to the end they ſhould be liberall: the reſt was given to the poore, &amp; other uſes. It is probable therefore that this Angel otherwiſe an excellent teacher is here taxed for coveteouſnes. From whence we firſt obſerve, that the godly faile in many things, and have need to be ſtirred up by admonitions and reprooſe, ſpecially when either they grow cold in their good affections, or are overcome with the cares of this preſent world, and the deſire of wealth and honour: For the devil doth chiefly labour to enſnare all teachers by ſuch baits, and therefore they ought ſo much the more to take heed, leaſt hereby beeing over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, they become a ſcandall to the Church of God.</p>
                     <p>Obſerve ſecondly that ambition, and coveteouſneſſe in miniſters are the moſt lothſome vices that may be, and therefore they ought to be the more carefull for to avoid the ſame. We have an example of <hi>ambition</hi> in the diſciples. For when Chriſt ſpake to them of the croſſe, they were troubled about <hi>preeminency,</hi> asking <hi>who of them ſhould be the greatest.

                        </q> That is:

                     <p>Obſerve thirdly, though Chriſt doth commend the excellent workes, labour, &amp; conſtancy of the <hi>Angel</hi> of this Church: yet he was ſo farr from acknowledging any merit in him: as that on the contrary he ſharply reproves him for many grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous evils, and threatneth to caſt him off except be repent: For Chriſt doth narrowly ſee and obſerve all our actions, and ſtrictly weigheth all our workes in the ballance. Wherefore God forbid, we ſhould imagine to merit by any good we doe: though indeed hypocrites commonly ſo thinke: whereas the word of God doth teſtifie that all the workes, even of the moſt holy men on earth, are polluted with ſinne: <hi>and all our righteouſneſſes are as filthy ragges,</hi>

                     <p>Obſerve in the laſt place, that it is not enough to begin wel, but, if we looke for the recompence of reward, we muſt perſevere in wel doing unto the end. For hypocrites at firſt ſeeme very zealous, but afterward they grow luke warm, and at laſt are altogether cold, and ſo receive not the crowne of glory at the laſt day.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Remember from whence thou art fallen</hi>] This is the third part of the narration, being matter full of reproofe. Firſt the teacher is exhorted to conſider his fall.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96676:42"/>Secondly to repent of his many evils. Thirdly carefully to practiſe all his former holy workes of love and charity, now neglected. So that in this exhortation, we have briefly the nature of true repentance propounded unto us. <hi>Firſt</hi> to take notice of the ſinne committed,
<note place="margin">A deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</note> for how elſe ſhould we ſorrow for it, or amend the ſame. The 2 is to eſchew the evil, and doe the good. And 3 to manifeſt our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance by workes of piety, and love, both to God and our neighbour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>From whence thou art fallen</hi>] Hence it might ſeem to follow, that the ſaintes may fall away wholy from grace, and ſo periſh eternally: for if ſo holy a teacher fell from his firſt love, why may we not then conclude the uncertainty of the grace of faith,
<note place="margin">Whither the ſaintes may wholy fall away.</note> juſtification, perſeverance and ſalvation? and why ſhould we not doubt alſo of theſe things and ſtand in fear thereof? I confeſſe, had this Angel finally fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len away, there had been juſt cauſe of ſuch doubting: For no man can aſſuredly beleeve the certainty of his faith and ſalvation, who doubteth of the certainty of his perſeverance.</p>
                     <p>The expoſition of <hi>Ribera, &amp; Alcaſar</hi> in this place is ſound namely <hi>that he had not altogether loſt his love, foraſmuch as he indured ſo great things for the ſake of Christ, but that he lost much of his former zeal.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">How farre forth the ſaintes may fall.</note> In this we agree with them. For the ſaintes left to themſelves, will ſoon fall from their faith, love, perſeverance and ſalvation, if we onely have reſpect to ſecondary cauſes; to wit, the mutability of the will, the weakneſſe of man, the ſcandals of the world, and the ſubtilty and power <hi>of ſatan.</hi> For how ſhould we be able to withſtand all theſe, who are weak men, and ſubject to the common frailties of others, ſo long as we carrie about us this earthly taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle?
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.10. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26, 41. 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 10, 12. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5, 8.</note> For what ſaith the ſcripture? <hi>be not lift up, but fear: leaſt thou alſo be cut of: the ſpirit indeed is willing, but the fleſh is weak.

But if, on the contrary, we conſider either the unchangeable counſell of God, touching the ſalvation of the elect: or the moſt effectuall interceſſion of Chriſt for their faith, perſeverance and ſalvation: or laſtly the power of God, by which as the Apoſtle witneſſeth, the elect are kept unto the end, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, then we may with the holy ſcriptures firmly conclude, that the faithfull cannot wholy and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally fall from the habit, and act of faith and love, I ſay, ſo to fall as to become Gods enemies,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3, 9. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24, 24.</note> and periſh for ever: becauſe <hi>whoſoever is born of God ſinneth not</hi> (to wit, with his whole wil, &amp; that unto death) <hi>for his ſeed remaineth in him, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſinne, becauſe he is borne of God: for it is impoſſible the elect ſhould be deceived,</hi> (to wit,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10, 28 <hi>Luke</hi> 22, 32. <hi>Se alſo Matth.</hi> 7, 25. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37, 24. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1, 5</note> finally unto their damnation,) <hi>becauſe no man can plucke Chriſts ſheep out of his hand: but he giveth unto them life eternall.</hi> And therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi> I <hi>have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.</hi> And God promiſed <hi>to put his fear into their harts, that they may not depart from him:</hi> which is, <hi>as Auguſtine</hi> interpreteth it, <hi>that they might alwayes cleave unto him: for they are as mount Sion which cannot be moved, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe and many other ſuch places of ſcripture as they doe plainly overthrow that <hi>Pelagian error of the ſaintes apoſiaſie:</hi> and the fear of being finally drawen away, and doubting about grace and ſalvation decreed by the <hi>counſell of Trent:</hi> ſo alſo they doe confirme in regard of the free purpoſe of God, the certainety of our perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in grace unto the end: howſoever I denie not, but the elect many times by their ſinnes diſturbe their peace and aſſurance, having their mindes troubled with manifold doubtings: for as men, we are ſubject to humane frailties, and ſhall bee, ſo long as we are here in this life.</p>
                     <p>So then we expound; <hi>From whence thou art fallen,</hi> to be, as if he had ſaid, in what thou art gon back from thy former zeal in godlineſſe, fervencie and love: and art become unlike to what thou waſt before. So then Chriſt commends the teacher of the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> for his conſtancy in the truth, and hatred of hereſie: but reproveth him for his languiſhing, coveteouſneſſe, and ambition.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96676:42"/>Hence we ſo that it is not ſufficient to profeſſe the truth, unleſſe it be done in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of faith, and humility.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Or elſe I will come unto thee quickly</hi>] This threatning is the fourth part of the narration, being a moſt vehement exhortation, and ſheweth the pernicious effects of ſecurity, and coveteouſneſſe. Two things are threatned. 1: <hi>I will come to thee quickly,</hi> that is, thou ſhalt ſuddenly be puniſhed before thou art aware of it. Thus impenitent perſons provoke Chriſt the judge againſt themſelves, whoſe wrath they are not able to bear: for he is <hi>a conſuming fire. Do we</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>provoke the Lord to jealouſie? are we stronger then he?</hi> So that the firſt reaſon why we ſhould repent, is becauſe of the power and juſtice of Chriſt and our owne weakneſſe. The ſecond thing threatned, is the removal of the <hi>candleſticke,</hi> that is, Chriſt would not onely thruſt him out of his office, but alſo remove the <hi>candleſticke,</hi> that is, the Church it ſelf by the enemies thereof. <hi>Andreas: I will caſt the Church into a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, and tempeſtuous condition,</hi> which puniſhment ordinarily followes ſecurity, and contempt of the word. And indeed Chriſt did not in vain threaten this Church, for afterward (they not repenting) he removed their <hi>candleſticke,</hi> and overthrew them by barbarous nations.</p>
                     <p>Here commeth in a twofold queſtion: <hi>firſt,</hi> how it can ſtand with equity, that the whole Church ſhould be diſſipated for the ſinnes of the teacher: ſecondly, how the removing of this candleſticke is threatned, ſeeing the Church is built on the <hi>rock,</hi> againſt which the gates of hell cannot prevaile: and the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> calleth this very Church of <hi>Epheſus, the houſe of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth:</hi> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ribera</hi> ſaith, that the <hi>first</hi> is a difficult queſtion: Becauſe Chriſt threatneth not the paſtor, but indeed the whole Church: whereas it ſeems unreaſonable, that the whole ſhould be puniſhed, for the impenitency of the teacher. Hence he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that the <hi>candleſticke</hi> in this place imports, not the Church, but the Epiſcopal function and dignity, unto which he was advanced, to be a light before the flook: ſo that by the <hi>removing of the candleſticke,</hi> he underſtandeth a removal of the <hi>Epiſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>pal honour,</hi> and thoſe things in which he was wont to excell, as in the word and doctrine, and ſundry other vertues and gifts with which he was indued. This interpretation is not altogether incongruous: however we need not alter the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the candleſticke; foraſmuch as it is not unuſuall or contradictorie to divine juſtice, that God ſhould puniſh a whole congregation, for the ſinnes of a few, yea for one particular perſon in the ſame, as the Apoſtle ſheweth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6, <hi>&amp;</hi> 11.30. And the reaſon hereof is, becauſe oftentimes the multitude followes the examples of their governors: <hi>like prieſt, like people:</hi> as is the king, ſuch is the ſubject: wherefore it is probable that the Church had loſt her <hi>firſt love,</hi> as well as her reachertand hence the threatning is directed againſt him as chiefe; and againſt the congregation as being corrupted alſo.</p>
                     <p>To the <hi>ſecond,</hi> I anſwer by diſtinguiſhing the Church: which is either particular, or univerſal. The univerſal is perpetual, unſhaken, and built upon the <hi>rock.</hi> But we beleeve otherwiſe of particular Churches, which oftentimes the Lord for their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity removeth, by overthrowing whole cities, &amp; countries, as the <hi>Eaſterne Greek Churches of Aſia and Africa</hi> doe plainly witneſſe. But although particular congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations are diſſipated, and the <hi>candlesticke</hi> removed, either for publick or private ſinnes; ſo that where formerly the light of Gods word did ſhine, there afterwards <hi>Paganiſme</hi> or <hi>Antichriſtianiſme</hi> doth reigne: not withſtanding the church it ſelfe is not alwaies removed: for the abode of the Church is uncertaine,

                     <p>That which is ſpoken, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15, as it is moſt true of the univerſall Church: ſo was it likewiſe true of theſe Epheſians, yea of every particular congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſay in right, though not alwaies in fact: for indeed every congregation ought to be a <hi>pillar and ground of truth;</hi> though it be not ſo ſtill in truth: according
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96676:43"/>to that of Mala. 2.7, <hi>The priests lips preſerve knowledge,</hi> that is they ought ſo to doe, though they did it not, &amp; therefore are reproved by the Prophet, verſ. 8, <hi>But ye are departed out of the way, &amp;c.</hi> ſo the Church is the <hi>pillar,</hi> that is, ought to be the <hi>pillar:</hi> according to that in <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.6,

                     <p>Hence we <hi>firſt</hi> obſerve, ſeeing the abode of the Church is uncertain, we muſt not promiſe to our ſelves a continuance in one place, in regard we are citizens of the Church. For it is in the power of Chriſt, to remove the <hi>candlesticks</hi> from one place to another, and many times he doth ſo for the ſinnes either of the teachers, or of the whole congregation: Now in this we muſt acknowledge our own faults, as deſerving it:

Let us therefore ſtedfaſtly perſevere in our firſt faith, and amend the evils, whither in paſtors or Church, that ſo the <hi>candleſticke</hi> be not removed.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, hence we learn, that true repentance is the onely way and means to eſcape publick puniſhment, and Church diſſipation. For Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I will remove thee, unleſſe thou repent:</hi> meaning if thou repent, I will not remove thee.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, obſerve, that in ſcripture, the threatnings of puniſhment are ſtill with a condition, either expreſſed or underſtood: <hi>viz. except men repent.</hi> And therefore when the condition of repentance is declared, and the puniſhment followes not there is no change at all in the decree of God.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, hence we may learn, how ſuch as go aſtray are to be brotherly reproved and corrected for their evils, and brought to true repentance: the obſtinate are to be terrified with threatnings: and the repentant raiſed up with comfort: the which Chriſt doth to this Church, as knowing this to be a moſt effectuall means to bring them to amendment of life.</p>

                           <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2.</note> which the wicked cannot deprive them of: for by faith they inherit Chriſt: <hi>Who is the heire of all things:</hi> And <hi>in whom are hid all the treaſures of wiſedome and knowledge.</hi>

This is indeed one of the <hi>Paradoxes</hi> of our religion: that Chriſtians are rich in God, though poore to the world. Now this thing ought not to ſeem ſtrange unto us, ſeeing heathen philoſophers could ſay, <hi>that onely wiſe men are rich men:</hi> in as much as wiſedome alone ſufficeth to make a man bleſſed: but how much more then doth the true knowledge of God and of Chriſt, inrich us with all ſpiritual bleſſings, whatſoever becomes of our tranſitorie goods in this life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And the blaſphemie of them</hi>] That is, the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who perſecuted the Chriſtians, bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemed Chriſt, counted him a deceiver, a magician, and juſty crucified opbraiding the Chriſtians to be idle and fooliſhmen,
<note place="margin">Apolog. cap. ult.</note> worthy of nothing but ſtripes, torments, hanging &amp; the like, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> recordeth. Now theſe blaſphemers named them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (for honour ſake) <hi>Iewes,</hi> as if they were the onely people of God. But, Chriſt ſaith, they are <hi>no Iewes,</hi> but a <hi>Synagogue of Satan,</hi> that is, a <hi>blaſphemous congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> led by Satan to their deſtruction. Thus Chriſt applies the title of their <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue,</hi> wherin they boaſted, to their ſhame and approbrie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And are not</hi>] <hi>For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly, neyther is that circumciſion which is outward in the fleſh: but he which is one inwardly &amp;c.</hi> Here we ſee that titles availe not when men are degenerated, and forſake the truth. The ſame may be ſaid of the title of the Church, which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſo much boaſt of; we, ſay they, are the Church, the Church: we grant indeed they are ſo: but not a Church of Chriſt, but of Satan, who worſhip not God, but the divel in their <hi>Idols.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now wheras Chriſt is ſaid to know theſe things, as it ſerves againe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the tenth argument of his deity: So to comfort thoſe of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and all the godly in their affliction: for it is as much as if he thus ſaid: Although I may ſeem to be afar of, &amp; ignorant of your condition, in that I take not away your poverty, and puniſh the blaſphemers: yet nothing is hid from me, but all things are naked and bare before mee; he patient therefore until the time of your deliverance come. And this may be added to Argum. 11. proving the Godhead of Chriſt, namely his immenſitie and providence.</p>
                     <p n="10">10 <hi>Feare none of thoſe things, which thou ſhalt ſuffer</hi>] The other part of the narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is a praemonition of their troubles at hand: for howſover they had already ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered much; yet he foretelleth that they muſt indure greater things: not in the leaſt to diſharten them, but that they might prepare themſelves before hand for the ſame.</p>
                     <p>For darts foreſeen are the leſſe hurtful: as alſo leaſt they ſhould be ſecure, and imagine that after their former ſufferings, they were to looke for no farther com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats but on the contrarie to fore arm themſelves for them.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. In this we may behold the afflicted condition of the godly in this world, &amp; all that wil live godly muſt prepare themſelves for it: but if it ſo be, that we have a more peaceable portion let us account it as a great mercie of God, &amp; enioy it with thanckfulneſſe,

3.

Hence let us obſerve in the firſt place, that the crowne of life is promiſed onely to ſuch as are faythfull to the death. 2.

Here we have the fifteenth argument of Chriſts Godhead:
<note place="margin">XV <hi>Argu. of Chr. deity.</hi>
                        </note> For the word of God, doth properly proceed out of his mouth: and therefore he is God. Becauſe the word of God proceedeth from Chriſt, not as the word of another, or as it was in the mouth of the Apoſtles, Prophets and other teachers, but in ſpeciall as his owne: hence he ſaith, v. 16. <hi>I will fight with them, with the ſword of my mouth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="13">13. <hi>I know thy workes, and where thou dwellest</hi>] In the narration, are three things: he commendeth what is prayſe-worthy: reproveth what is amiſſe; and laſty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth them unto repentance. Firſt he ſaith in Generall, that he <hi>knew their workes,</hi> to the end they might take notice, that they had to doe with him who trieth and ſearcheth the hearts and reynes, of which ſe v. 2.2. In particular he commends their conſtancie in the faith, which with courage they maintained, and confidently truſting on Chriſt, overcame all ſuch tentations as might any way occaſion them to forſake him. The prayſe whereof is amplified from the danger of their abode: <hi>I know where thou dwelleſt,</hi> namely in a moſt vicious and wicked city, being ful of cruel enemies, both Iewes and Gentiles, and where Chriſtians like ſheep are continually expoſed to the danger of devouring wolves: Now to live Godly in ſuch a place, and conſtantlie to cleave unto the profeſſion of Chriſts name, is a verie hard thing: though it be not ſo, where the condition of the place affords us freedom and libertie: the which benefit God of his exceeding mercie, hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto granted unto us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Where Satans ſeat is</hi>] A further amplifying of their conſtancie is taken from the infamie of the place: <hi>Pergamus</hi> is the throne of the Divel: Who in Hebr. is called <hi>Satan</hi> that is <hi>an adverſarie:</hi> ſo that this citie was full of naughtie and vile perſons, haters of Chriſt, and his members, among whom Satan raigned, both in the pallace (for it was the abode of king <hi>Attalus</hi>) and in their ſenate, &amp; temples: forcibly drawing the magiſtrates and cityzens to horrible Idolatrie, and to commit all manner of outrage and wickednes againſt the Chriſtians. Nevertheles Chriſt had a Church in this evill citie. And could he not doe the like,
<note place="margin">The Church preſerved in the papacie.</note> though the <hi>Romiſh Papacie</hi> for a thouſand yeares and upward, hath been the <hi>throne of Satan,</hi> and the <hi>ſeat of Antichriſt,</hi> and under the name of Chriſtianitie, abounds in all ungodlineſſe, idolatrie, and barbarous crueltie againſt Chriſt? They object, that the Church of <hi>Pergamus</hi> was viſible, and ſeparated from the <hi>Pagans:</hi> But in the papacie it was not ſo.

But be it granted: were not the ſeven thouſand in Iſrael, who worſhipped God, a Church: becauſe they were not a viſible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation ſeperated from the Balaamites, but for fear of perſecution kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves cloſe, and were not known, no not to <hi>Elias</hi> himſelf?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Even in thoſe days</hi>] Here he further amplifies their conſtancie by ſhewing the crueltie of the adverſaries, who continually drew forth the Chriſtians to moſt cruel and barbarous torments, as appeares by <hi>Antipas, a faithfull martyr of Chriſt,</hi> who undoubtedly not long before was put to death by thoſe of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> and ſo is named inſtead of many others, who alſo ſuffered. It is not certain by hiſtorie, who he was. <hi>Arethas</hi> ſuppoſeth that he was the teacher of this Church, who in the days of <hi>Domitian,</hi> for his conſtant profeſſion of the truth was (as ſome ſay) put into a <hi>Brazen bul</hi> and by fyre tortured to death: <hi>Andreas</hi> writeth, that he had read ſometime the hyſtory of his martyrdom. But it is certain that Chriſt honoureth him with the title of <hi>his faithfull witneſſe.</hi> It is probable that this Epiſtle was directed to the ſucceſſour of <hi>Antipas,</hi> leaſt he ſhould be drawen aſide from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming his charge, for fear of the like puniſhment: who as it ſeemeth was at this time in bonds, and threatned, to be tortured to the end he might denie Chriſt: and therfore he is worthily commended for keeping the faith. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Where Satan dwelleth</hi>] The fourth amplification is from the danger of the place, or a further declaring of what was before ſpoken of <hi>Pergamus:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>Pergamus</hi> is not onely the ſeat of Satan, in which he remaineth ſomtimes, or for a ſeaſon: but it is his proper neſt, and where he continually inhabiteth: <hi>for</hi> (as Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thas witneſſeth) <hi>Pergamus was more given to Idolatrie, then any other place in Aſia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hel indeed properly is Satans dwelling place; notwithſtanding he alſo dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and reighneth in the harts of the children of diſobedience, who by their filthie and abominable actions, doe inſlave themſelves unto him. Thus the hart of <hi>Judas</hi> was as a houſe for Satan, after he was entred into him: O what a miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is it, to live there where Satan dwelleth? how hard a matter is it to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip Chriſt, where the Divel ruleth? Let us therefore intreat the lord to dwel in the midſt of us, and to make us the temples of his holy ſpirit, that ſo Satan may not have any abode amongſt us.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. <hi>But I have a few things againſt thee</hi>] This ſecond part of the narration is a reproofe of the Biſhop of <hi>Pergamus.</hi> And here again we are taught that the beſt in the Church are not without their faylings, the which Chriſt ſeeth, though men perceive them not, neither are we here to expect a Church perfect and altogither free from errours and the mixture of evill men and good togither: for which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities albeit the lord doth not condemne us, but in mercie paſſeth them by: notwithſtanding he diſaloweth and reproveth them, and requireth an amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof. He calleth them (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) <hi>a few things</hi> comparitively: not as being few or ſmal in themſelves, but eyther as reſpecting the evils of ungodly men: or in regard of his owne clemencie, he accounting them but as few. Thus the Lord leſſens (as it were) our evils, yet ſo, not that we ſhould flatter our ſelves in them, but the rather amend them: for a few evils are ſooner reformed then many: leſſer vices are more eaſilie corrected, then greater.</p>
                     <p>Now the evil for which they are blamed, is their remiſnes in not exerciſing Church diſcipline againſt ſuch perſons as were infected with the venemous do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Balaamites, and Nicolaitans.</hi> Now whether theſe were divers ſects, or but one, it is not certaine. The common opinion is, that the <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> followed the wicked way of <hi>Balaam,</hi> (mentioned in <hi>Numb.</hi> 22.23.24.25.) permitting Chriſtians <hi>to eat things ſacrificed to Idols, and to commit fornication.</hi> For that falſe prophet being hired by <hi>Balack</hi> king of <hi>Moab</hi> to curſe the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> gave him counſel by his <hi>Moabitiſh woemen</hi> to entiſe them to worſhip Baal-peor, or their God <hi>Priapus:</hi> by which meanes it came to paſſe, that the Iſraelites having ſo don, fel to feaſtings and dancings with them, and afterwards committing fornication, drew upon themſelves horrible plagues from the Lord.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. <hi>So haſt thou alſo them</hi>] Becauſe he had before reproved the Church of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> for <hi>the deeds of the Nicolaitans:</hi> therefore here he ſaith, <hi>ſo hast thou alſo &amp;c.</hi> By which it appeareth, that this ſect, whatever it were, was crept into many Churches.</p>
                     <p>Hence we note two things, concerning the dutie of Churches and their officers, touching notorious-ſectaries.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that it is meet to call them by the name of their authors. For Chriſt, nameth the <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> after <hi>Nicolas,</hi> to diſtinguiſh them from ſuch as were ſound in the faith. This I ſpeak of vile ſectaries, ſuch as theſe were, overthrowing the very foundation. Yet it followes not, that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> do wel, to call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves after <hi>Luther,</hi> unleſſe they would be accounted notorious ſectaries, rending Chriſt aſunder, as in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. of which thing ſe more v. 6.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, notorious ſectaries ought to be ſeriouſly reproved by the Church, convinced, &amp; if it may be regained: as for the obſtinate they are not to be ſuffered, but to be caſt out of the Church, otherwiſe we provoke the Lord to wrath againſt our ſelves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:96676:47"/>
But here behold the great ungodlines of the <hi>Romiſh Antichrist,</hi> who to bring in his diveliſh doctrine of forbidding marriage, accounts all ſuch Biſhops and Prieſts which do marrie, guiltie of the haereſie of the Nicolaitans: &amp; this he doth, if we wil beleeve him, to preſerve the puritie of the Church. See, <hi>Sigon. de regno Ital. lib.</hi> 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. <hi>Repent, or otherwiſe</hi>] The third part of the narration, is an exhortation to repentance, with a threatning of the obſtinate, unleſſe they left their errour. For it ſeemeth that the <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> were not ſecretly, but openly retained in the boſome of the Church, by the indulgence of the Paſtor, &amp; ſo publickly maintained their wicked doctrine to the ſcandall of the faithful, and danger of the whole Church: <hi>For a little leaven leaveneth the whole lumpe.</hi> Beſides, becauſe of this,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6.</note> the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeving Gentiles ſpake evil of the Chriſtians, as if they committed fornication each with other. Thus we ſee that their ſinne was of a high nature, and therfore great reaſon had Chriſt to require repentance for the ſame.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I wil come againſt thee ſhortly</hi>] The like phraſe of threatning is in v. 6. and the ſame kind of puniſhement is applied to the diſcription of Chriſt v. 12. as if he ſhould ſay; It is not in vain that I have <hi>a two edged ſword in my mouth:</hi> for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I wil ſtrike and wound the unrepentant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I wil fight against them</hi>] Chriſt then fighteth againſt us with <hi>the ſword of his mouth,</hi> when he reproveth our evils, threatneth &amp; puniſheth obſtinate ſinners. For Gods threatnings are never without effect: But as it is written, <hi>unleſſe ye repent,

                              <hi>Luk</hi> 13.3</note> ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi> Chriſt fighteth <hi>with a ſword,</hi> to convince, wound, condemne and caſt off the irrecoverable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Againſt them</hi>] To wit, the <hi>Nicolaitans:</hi> notwithſtanding he includeth the Paſtor alſo, with the Church it ſelf except they repented: ſo that <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>
                        <hi>To eat of the hid Manna</hi>] This is the firſt. <hi>Manna</hi> was that heavenly bread, ſweet in taſt, with which God fed his people in the wildernes, who being preſſed with hunger found in the morning without the camp an heavenly dew like to <hi>Coria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der,</hi>

                     <p>This name God wil not give to one alone, but to all the faithful, all (I ſay) ſhall know their owne name, becauſe all ſhal have it.

                     <p>And heere the ungodly aſſertion of the papiſts is refuted, who affirme that no man can fullie and certainly perſwade himſelfe of his own inward juſtifying faith, or to be in the ſtate of grace, and ſo conſequently a childe of God: but is to doubt of his faith, grace, juſtification, adoption and ſalvation.

                     <p>For the knowledge of this <hi>new name,</hi> it conſiſts not in bare ſpeculations, but in the power and practiſe of the heart.

                        <hi>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Nto the Angel of the Church of Thyatira</hi>] <hi>Epiphanius</hi> recordeth that certaine of the <hi>Alogians</hi> rejected the <hi>Revelation</hi> as fabulous, becauſe there was no Chriſtian Church at that time in <hi>Thyati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra. For how,</hi> ſay they, <hi>could Iohn be commanded to write to one, who then was not,</hi> but that old writer ſheweth the abſurditie of the hereticks herein, <hi>It followeth not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>although in their dayes there was no Church there, therefore there was none in Iohns time: for Thyatira was vanquiſhed and overthrowen by them and the Phrygians togither, Not long after the death of Iohn and the other Apoſtles, namely in the three and nynteth yeere after Christs aſcenſion, which was the ſeventh of Adrian the Emperor. And that indeed the ſpirit of God did foreſhew the defection of this Church, by propheſying of the falſe Propheteſſe Iezabel, that is, of certain woemen who deceived many, falſely boasting of a prophetical ſpirit, as namely, Priſcilla and Maximilla, and Quintilla harlots of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus, who taught the hereſie of the Cataphrygians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Touching theſe things whither they were ſo, or or, I wil not now diſpute of, but that which <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ads, is indeed more to the purpoſe, to wit, that in his time this Church was againe recovered by caſting off the hereſie of the <hi>Cataphry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians. Now,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>by the grace of God there is a Church in that place which flouriſheth,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:96676:49"/>and ſome others thereabout, although formerlie the whole Church was fallen away, and had embraced the aforeſaid hereſie.</hi> That alſo is verie memorable which he writeth, <hi>that the ſpirit of God did reveal, that ſoon after the Apoſtles &amp; their ſucceſſors the Church ſhould fal into many errors.</hi> Whence therefore hath the ſonne of perdition taken his inſolent decree, that his Church cannot erre?</p>
                     <p>Now the fourth Epiſtle is directed to the miniſter of Thyatira, being more ſharpe then the former. Hee is commended for his <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>workes,</hi> but reproved for ſuffering the <hi>Propheteſſe Jezabel</hi> to ſeduce many, to commit fornication, and eate things ſacrificed to Idols: the which woman, with her followers, Chriſt threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to deſtroy. Nevertheleſſe ſuch who were not infected with her wickednes, he exhorteth to conſtance, and promiſeth to give them power over the nations. The Epiſtle as the former conſiſteth, of an inſcription, narration and concluſion.</p>
                     <p>In the inſcription Chriſt is deſcribed by three Epithites: two whereof have been handled. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 14.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The ſonne of God</hi>] in <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.13. he is called the <hi>Sonne of Man,</hi> and here the <hi>Sonne of God,</hi> to ſhew that he is both: Now Chriſt is a Sonne by nature, we and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels by grace. Wherefore the Church doth rightly beleeve and profeſſe, Chriſt to be both God and man in the unitie of one perſon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>His eyes as a flame of fire, his feet like to fine braſſe</hi>] Of this ſee chap. 1.14.15.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I know thy workes</hi>] The narration containes five things: 1. commendations: 2. reproofes: 3. threatnings: 4. exhortations: 5. promiſes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thy workes</hi>] The <hi>Vulgar</hi> and <hi>Andreas</hi> omit this, both here, and in v. 9. <hi>Workes</hi> are generally to be taken both for good and evil, as in <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13. in ſpeciall he commendeth fower things: 1. <hi>his love,</hi> to God. 2. <hi>his charitie</hi> to the poore, and chiefly to them of the houſhould of faith. 3. <hi>his faith;</hi> that is, his ſincere preaching of the truth received from the Apoſtles. And laſtly <hi>his patience,</hi> in ſuffering of afflictions for the cauſe of Chriſt: for this Church alſo (if it be true which Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius writes) was perſecuted by the Pagans, Jewes and <hi>Cataphrygians,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this Biſhop remained ſtill conſtant in the truth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And thy workes, and the laſt</hi>] The firſt, <hi>and,</hi> is declarative, for, <hi>chiefly thy workes,</hi> the latter, <hi>and,</hi> ſeemeth not neceſſarie, and the text may thus be read, <hi>thy laſt workes are more then thy firſt,</hi> as the <hi>vulgar, Complutenſis,</hi> and <hi>Andreas</hi> read it. It ſeemeth that the Paſtor of this Church had with much courage lately undergone ſome great perſecution, for the which Chriſt here much commends him, as adding this exellent work to his former: or otherwiſe, becauſe in the general courſe of his life he daylie became more excellent: for his latter workes were <hi>more,</hi> that is, more manifeſt proofes of his conſtancie, and more worthie of praiſe then the firſt. So that he is commended for his holie progreſſe in the duties of piety: which is an example unto us, that we alſo ſhould labour to increaſe in the like workes of faith and love.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. <hi>But I have a few things againſt thee</hi>] The ſecond part, is a reproofe <hi>of few things,</hi> ſo the like in v. 14. not as if his evils were of no great corcernment, but Chriſt (like a good phyſitian) leſſens the diſeaſe, that the patient may the ſooner admit of the cure and not deſpaire of amendment. His evil was in permitting the falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheteſſe <hi>Jezabel</hi> to teach and ſeduce many, to commit fornication, and be preſent with idolaters at their worſhip and <hi>Idol feaſtings;</hi> for it ſeemeth this <hi>woman</hi> was one of the Sect of <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> whoſe doctrine ſhe maintained. For theſe decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers (under pretext of libertie and Chriſtian charitie) taught, that women were to be accounted common, &amp; that it was lawful for them to communicate with the heathen in their ſervices and feaſtings: now howſoever theſe things were ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and dangerous: yet of them thought indifferent and in the liberty of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: and this verie practice ſome libertines at this day doe imitate. This was a great neglect of zeale and courage in the Paſtor, in not ſeeking to redreſſe and free the Church of ſo peſtilent an inſtrument, but to ſuffer her amongſt them, to the deſtruction of many. Shee is called <hi>Jezabel</hi> by a ſimilitude, as being equal in
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:96676:49"/>craft and malice to <hi>Jezabel,</hi> the wife of <hi>Ahab:</hi> for as this vilde woman by falſe witneſſes cauſed <hi>Naboth</hi> uniuſtly to be put to death, and cruelly oppreſſed many of Gods prophets: ſo this <hi>lying Propheteſſe</hi> boaſting of divine revelations, led aſide many from the waye of God to her filthineſſe and deviliſh worſhip of Idols. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters doe differ, whither this was one woman, or many: and whither there were a whole Sect and nation of them. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> as we have already ſhewed, ſuppoſeth this: to be ſpoken of <hi>Priſcilla, Maximilla</hi> and <hi>Quintilla</hi> falſe Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſes of <hi>Montunus,</hi> who blaſphomouſly boaſting himſelf to be the <hi>comforter,</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced theſe women to commit fornication with him, and to Propheſie in his name. But on the contrarie the text ſheweth, that it is ſpoken of <hi>Jezabel,</hi> who at that time bore ſway in the Church of <hi>Thyatira</hi> and not of any to come afterward: neither is it likely that onely this Epiſtle ſhould reprove vices to come, when as all the other ſpeak of things preſent. <hi>Andreas</hi> underſtandeth it by a <hi>figurative ſpeech</hi> as meant of the hereſie of the <hi>Nicolaitans:</hi> But wherfore ſhould that ſect be here darkned with ſuch a kind of ſpeech, which twife before was manifeſtly named and treated of. <hi>Alcaſar</hi> coniectureth that by <hi>her</hi> the <hi>Iewiſh Synagogue</hi> is to be underſtood. But there is no reaſon to tranſform the Iewes into the woman <hi>Iezabel,</hi> who were before <hi>v.</hi> 9. comdemned by name, and again in <hi>cha.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 9. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the whole deſcription tends to ſet forth in ſpecial ſome one particular wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked woman: ſeing therfore there is no neceſſarie reaſon leading us to depart from the literal ſence, it is probable that this woman was verie famous in the city of <hi>Thyatira</hi> for her wealth, authoritie, and ſhew of pietie, but in truth for her unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, deceit and ungodlines, was equal with <hi>Iezabel</hi> of old, ſeducing many to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the truth, and participate with her in horrible wickednes: But touching this woman and her mentioned <hi>chap.</hi> 17. who is called <hi>a great citie,</hi> there is no agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betwixt them. For there it is expreſſly ſaid, that by her is ſignified a <hi>great multitude,</hi> yea <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf: whereas here no ſuch thing is intimated.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. <hi>And I gave her time</hi>] This ſheweth Chriſts patience and the obſtinacie of this woman, who made no uſe of his long ſufferance in giving her time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. Thus the wicked grow ſecure becauſe of Gods forbearance, and ſeeing Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not ſpeedilie executed, they rejoyce, and thinke to go unpuniſhed. But what their reward ſhall bee is plain both from this place, and <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4.5.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. <hi>I will cast her</hi>] The third part of the narration, is a threatning of judgment, which men by their inpenitencie bring upon themſelves. The puniſhment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced is threefold. 1. Againſt the woman herſelf. 2. Againſt her lovers. And 3. againſt her children. <hi>Jezabel</hi> is threatned with a foule diſeaſe, for ſo God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly puniſheth impure harlots, to make them lothſome to others, and publick exampels of diſhoneſt courſes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Into a bed</hi>] The antecedent is explained by the conſequence. Sick perſons keep their bed: the ſence is, the bed which ſhe hitherto had abuſed to laſciviouſnes, luxurie and pleaſure, ſhould be changed into languiſhing and ſorrow. But the Godly man the <hi>Lord wil ſtrongthen him upon the bed of languiſhing,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41.3.</note> &amp; make all his bed in his ſickneſſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And them that commit adulterie with her</hi>] Her lovers ſhall alſo be puniſhed, eyther externally by the ſword of the magiſtrate or ſome others: or internally by torments of conſcience. But I rather take it to be meant of outward ſhame and puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſſe they repent</hi>] Behold the mercie and patience of God: he wil not deſtroy a moſt wretched harlot with her adulterers, before he cal them to repentance, being ready to forgive ſuch as amend their wayes: thus we ſee how repentance is the onely means to eſcape puniſhment. Some times indeed the Lord inflicts temporall chaſtiſement upon the repentant: but the ſame is both mitigated, and turned to their good, beſides none of them are eternallie puniſhed.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. <hi>And kil her children with death</hi>] He threatneth <hi>death</hi> to the children of this harlot: which ſome take properly for ſuch as were borne in fornication, whom
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:96676:50"/>the Lord would ſuddenlie deſtroy by a heavie judgment, that ſuch an adulterous generation might not be ſpread among men. Others take it metaphorically for her companions and lovers who defyled themſelves with her. I rather approve the former ſence, for otherwiſe the difference between the adulterers, and their children would be taken away.</p>
                     <p>Hence we may learn, 1. that the lord is greatly offended with the defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments both of our ſoules and bodies: for he is a pure and holy ſpirit: and requireth the ſame in them that worſhip him:
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.14.</note> And without this no man ſhall ſee him. 2. The corrupters of the truth ſhall be grievouſly puniſhed, howſoever they may for a time by ſubtiltie cover their deceit, and draw many into their ſnares. 3. That God is ready to forgive moſt vile ſinners if they truelie repent.
<note place="margin">XVII <hi>Arg. of Chr. deity.</hi>
                        </note> Laſtly here we have the ſeventeenth argument of the deitie of Chriſt: in that he threatneth to puniſh theſe wicked deceivers: for none but God onelie is able to doe it, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it manifeſteth his divine omnipotencie. That which the hereticke objects concerning <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtriking the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> with plagues, is of no waight: neither of <hi>Peter</hi> his ſlaying of <hi>Ananias:</hi> Nor Pauls ſtriking <hi>Elymas</hi> with blindeneſſe. For we know, that the Prophets and Apoſtles wrought miracles, not of themſelves, but by the power of God. Wheras Chriſt threatens to doe this by his owne power,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Io.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Mat</hi> 10.1 <hi>&amp;</hi> 16.17.</note> 
                        <hi>For whatſoever things the Father doth, theſe alſo doth the Son likewiſe.</hi> Yea the Son giveth power unto others to doe the like things.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And all the Churches ſhall know</hi>] The end and uſe of Gods vengeance on ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, is to declare both his omniſcience of the hidde things of the hart: as alſo his omnipotencie and Iuſtice in rendring to evry one according to his workes: Even as God ſaid to <hi>Pharoah:
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Exo.</hi> 9.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.17</note> And in very deed, for this cauſe have I rayſed thee up, for to ſhew in thee my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.</hi> Thus the lord by threatning cals ſinners to repentance, by Iudgments puniſheth the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and hereby declareth his wiſedome, power and Iuſtice unto all.</p>
                     <p>Now it is not without cauſe, that Chriſt attributes to himſelfe the knowledge of hidden things: for ſeeing this wicked woman, beguiled many, by couveringe her uncleane actions under a pretence of holineſſe: Chriſt therefore here declares that none of her wayes were hidden from his eyes.</p>
                     <p>Hence we obſerve in the firſt place, that one principal end of Gods exemplarie puniſhing of the wicked, is that all the Churches may acknowledge &amp; declare the wiſedome, power, and Iuſtice of God. Thus we ſe how profitable it is, that publike examples are propounded before our eyes, to the end we may take notice of the judgments of God, &amp; beware leaſt by the like wickedneſſe we ſtirre up his wrath againſt our owne ſoules.

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly here is offred unto us the eighteenth argument excellently proving the divinity of Chriſt. For here Chriſt will be acknowledged to be the ſearcher of the heart and reynes: which the ſcripture aſcribeth unto God alone. <hi>For the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous God trieth the heart and reynes.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Eniedinus</hi> the <hi>Samoſatenian,</hi> objecteth in the firſt place, that the ſearching of the heart and reines doth not here ſignifie a knowledge of the thoughts: But rather a moſt equal and juſt adminiſtration of judgment by Chriſt: and ſo it proveth not that he is true God.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer. The antecedent is a manifeſt and bold corrupting of the text: For the divine attribute which elſewhere is aſcribed to <hi>Jehova,</hi> is here without any limitation and in the verie ſame words applied unto Chriſt: not onely in regard of the adminiſtration of his righteous judgments, but alſo as he is the ſearcher of the heart: and therefore muſt neceſſarily be taken in one and the ſame ſence.</p>
                     <p>But again he objecteth. That Chriſt hath received all his knowledge &amp; judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yea and himſelf too, from the Father, as he confeſſeth, <hi>Io.</hi> 5. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.11. &amp; here <hi>v.</hi> 27. <hi>as I have received from my Father:</hi> ſo that he is not the ſame God with the Father.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="51" facs="tcp:96676:50"/>
I anſwer: he deceiveth by an equivocation. For Chriſt receiveth all things from the father two maner of wayes;
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Io</hi> 1.14. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.25</note> God the ſonne hath received his divine eſſence from the Father by eternal generation, <hi>for he is the onely begotten of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, before the mountaines were ſetled.</hi> So that with his divine eſſence he received his divine omniſcience. But as he is man, he received all his power and glorie in time, by his reall exaltation, ſo far forth as conſiſted with the nature and perfection of his manhood: in this latter reſpect we confeſſe he is not God: notwithſtanding it is falſe, to affirme that he is not God in the former: for howſoever in this reſpect he hath received all things from the Father: yet whatſoever is divine, the Sonne hath it by his owne eſſence, even as the Father: <hi>Becauſe the Father hath given to the Sonne, to have life in himſelf, as the Father hath life in himſelf.</hi> See <hi>Damaſcenus lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Orth. fid. cap.</hi> 19.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly he objecteth that many Prophets and Apoſtles knew the hearts of men alſo.
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Io.</hi> 5.26.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>I anſwer. Eyther this, or that of <hi>Salomon</hi> is falſe, <hi>Thou onely knoweſt the hearts of all men,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.39. God indeed did reveal ſome things (not al things) unto <hi>Eliſha, Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> but not the knowledge of the hearts. To be ſhort none of them did, or could ſay, that he was the ſearcher of the reynes and heart, as Chriſt here ſaith; <hi>And all the Churches ſhal know, that I am the ſearcher of the reynes &amp; hearts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="24">24. <hi>But unto you I ſay</hi>] The fourth part of the narration is an exhortation, and here he turnes aſide from the Paſtor before commended and reproved, and from the deceivers threatned, and ſpeakes to the reſt of the Church in <hi>Thyatira,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts ſuch as were godly among them, and had not harkened unto the falſe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, to go foreward and continue in the Apoſtles doctrine.

The <hi>Vulgar,</hi> as alſo <hi>Andreas</hi> and <hi>Montanus</hi> read it without the copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, <hi>but to you the reſt,</hi> but the other Greeke copies have it, <hi>to you, and to the reſt,</hi> as if he had ſaid, to thee o Paſtor and to thy fellow officers and to the reſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>J know thy workes</hi>] The firſt part of the narration is a reproofe of the ſecret hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie in the heart &amp; life of this teacher. <hi>Thy works,</hi> that is, I ſee al the indeavours &amp; cariage both of thy private life &amp; publick miniſtry: I know thy hidden hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie: for ſo he explaineth it: <hi>thou haſt a name that thou liveſt, &amp; art dead,</hi> that is, thou art generally reputed to be a faithful &amp; godly teacher; but thou art an hypocrite as beeing deſtitute of faith and true holines, &amp; ſo <hi>dead,</hi> that is, as a painted ſepulchre before the Lord guiltie of death, although thou ſeemeſt to be alive &amp; holy before men. Hence we learne three remarkeable pointes.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is an evident argument of Chriſts divinitie. For if Chriſt ſo knowes
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:96676:52"/>all our workes, as that he diſcerneth betwixt true godlines, and hypocriſie the dead and living members of the Church, true paſtors and hypocrites: then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he tryeth the heart of man, which is onely proper to God, and is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable to any creature, no not unto the Angels. Which further confirmeth the X. and XVIII. argument before mentioned.</p>
                     <p>Secondly we are taught, that all who profeſſe the truth, and make a ſhew of holines, are not truely faithful and regenerate perſons, but many of them are hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites and deceivers, as being farre otherwiſe then they are accounted of for hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie is an outward ſhew of inward holineſſe: or a profeſſion of faith with the mouth, beeing in the mean time deſtitute thereof in the heart. And hence we may conclude that a bare profeſſion argues not true faith, as the patrones of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites affirme, whereby they oftentimes delude themſelves &amp; others.
<note place="margin">

                        <hi>Simon Magus</hi> is ſaid to beleeve. Therfore, (ſay they) ſome who profeſſe &amp; have true faith may fall away and periſh. But this place ſhewes us, that many are inwardly dead, who outwardly ſeem to be alive: being with <hi>Ananias</hi> the hie Prieſt, <hi>whyted walls,</hi>

Thus we ſe in ſcripture how they are ſaid not onely to be dead, who are deprived of naturall life, but alſo not beeing regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated to a ſpirituall: or who are ſincere in appearance onely, and not in truth. Let us therfore take notice that all are not godly, who ſeem ſo to be: neyther ſhall all they, who ſay <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> enter into the kingdome of God: for the Church conſiſteth of a mixture of ſaintes, and hypocrites: and this difference is not onely in the <hi>laitie,</hi> but chiefly in the <hi>Clergie,</hi> as they call it: that is, many who in ſheeps cloathing, ſeem to be true Paſtors &amp; teachers, are in truth but mercenarie wolves: and howſoever theſe may deceive men, yet Chriſt knowes them: And therfore let not the Biſhops of Antichriſt thinke to blinde the eyes of Chriſt, with their titles, mitres, and royal robes.</p>
                     <p>The conſideration of this informeth us in the firſt place, of the divers condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church in this world. For many are called to be members of the Church whereof ſome are good, others bad, ſome ſaintes, others hypocrites: like as the net takes in al manner of fiſhes.</p>
                     <p>But howſoever the faintes elected, are not knowen of men, yet God &amp; Chriſt doe diſcerne them. For <hi>the Lord knoweth who are his.</hi> Therefore let every one try and examine himſelf whether he be <hi>dead</hi> or <hi>alive:</hi> for hypocrites deceive not God, but man &amp; their owne ſoules. Wherfore let us ſhun hypocriſie even as a peſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring what <hi>Ambroſe</hi> admoniſheth, not to reſt contented with <hi>a bare name, &amp; in the mean while to be greevouſly guilty: or with the hight of honour while we abound in ſins: or with a profeſſion of Godlineſſe, while our actions are deviliſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For otherwiſe we ſhould onely have a name to live, when in deed we are but dead.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly obſerve, that the efficacie of the miniſtry doth not depend upon the goodnes of the miniſter. For God doth ſometime vivifie and governe his Church by <hi>dead officers,</hi> as we have here an example: which ſerves to confute the <hi>Donaliſts</hi> and Popiſh Sophiſters: who maintaine, that there was not any Church of the elect, <hi>untill the time of Luther</hi> in the <hi>Papacie</hi> but themſelves, except we wil acknowledge their Biſhops (for other there were none) to have been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of by the Lord.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Bee watchfull</hi>] The ſecond part of the narration is an exhortation, admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing the <hi>Angel</hi> in <hi>Sardis</hi> of divers things, to the end he might purge himſelf from the crime of hypocriſie: and withal he is threatned to be puniſhed except he doe repent.

Even ſo it becommeth Gods ministers, when the truth of God in any thing hath been changed, &amp; men have been unconſtant therin, to returne to the firſt original and Apoſtolical tradition, that the reaſon of our actions may flow from whence they had their firſt ſpring and original.</hi>

For then indeed we repent, when leaving our evil wayes, we order our ſteps aright, and ſeriouſly turne, to the Lord: the which I confeſſe, is not in our owne power to doe: but God gratiouſly effecteth the thing which he commandeth in whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he pleaſeth. Howbeit they are inexcuſable, in whom he worketh it not, becauſe they willingly diſobey the commandement. But it may be objected, they cannot doe it of themſelves. It is true indeed, but from whence doth this ariſe? for have they not of their owne accord brought this inabilitie uppon themſelves, and alſo by a voluntarie obſtinacie augmented it, wherby they have made themſelves inexcuſable, and ſelf guiltie before God?</p>

                     <p>But againe though the aſſumption were granted: yet would not the propoſition be univerſally true.

So <hi>Nero</hi> had honour, and was worthie of honour in regard of dutie, but not in regard of any vertue in him. So in particular our worthineſſe before God, is not becauſe of the worthineſſe of our workes, but of grace, by which he maketh us worthy, by calling, juſtifying and glorifying of us.

Firſt, <hi>He ſhall be cloathed with white raiments</hi>] This, by a metaphor, ſignifies the heavenly glorie with which we ſhall be cloathed, as with a royal garment. What more?</p>

                     <p>

                     <p>Hence we note, <hi>firſt,</hi> that the ſaintes are ſaid to have a two fould cloathing; for as we heard before, ſome in <hi>Sardis</hi> were commended for not defiling of their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and yet promiſed beſides to have other white garments given unto them: the former are ſaid to be ours, not as proceeding from our ſelves, but becauſe we are enioyned to have them, meaning, both morall endowments of bodie and mind: as alſo the grace of faith and love, and other ſpiritual gifts: which we muſt have and preſerve cleane and undefiled,
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.3.</note> that ſo we may be cloathed hereafter in white.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondlie,</hi> we are to take notice, that in ſcripture, God is ſaid metaphorically to have a threefold booke. The <hi>first</hi> is the booke of his providence, which is the knowledge and counſel of God concerning the actions and events of all things firſt and laſt, of this the prophet ſpeaketh <hi>Pſa.</hi> 139.6.16. &amp;c. <hi>all things are written in thy booke. The other,</hi> is the booke of Gods univerſal judgment, which is his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge concerning all thoſe things which everie one hath don whither it be good or evil, and to be judged accordingly in the laſt day: as in cha. 20.12. <hi>and the bookes were opened. The third,</hi> is the booke of life, that is, Gods praedeſtinating both of the elect and reprobates:
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pſ.</hi> 69.29. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Phili.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Reve.</hi> 18.8 <hi>&amp;</hi> 17.8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22.19.</note> the firſt are ſaid to be written in this booke, the other not, but blotted out: of this the ſcripture ſpeakes in many places: yet that in <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.12. <hi>then the bookes were opened,</hi> may be underſtood of them all: for in the ſame verſe, the <hi>booke of life</hi> is expreſly mentioned: Thus God is ſaid to have bookes me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphoricallie. Not as if eyther he hath, or ſtood in need thereof: for ſo it cannot bee, but by an <hi>Anthropopatheia</hi> he ſpeaketh to our capaſitie: For God doth all things without ſuch help or meanes, even by his eternal foreknowledge, counſel, government and judgment. But thus men cannot doe, for whatſoever is don in their counſels, cities, families, contracts &amp;c. for memory ſake is ſet down in writing, that ſo as there is occaſion, they may looke it over and call to mind ſuch things, as they deſire.</p>
                     <p>Now concerning the elect,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.20.</note> two things here are ſpoken of them: <hi>Firſt,</hi> that their names are written in the <hi>booke of life. Phil.</hi> 4.3. or in heaven: as <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.20. by which manner of ſpeech we are taught, that true beleevers doe not obtaine ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by chance, but were elected of God to life in Chriſt before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the world: and known from them that periſh. <hi>Secondly,</hi> their names are never blotted out of this booke, as it is here teſtified, <hi>J will not blot out his name out of the booke of life.</hi> By which phraſe is ſignifyed, that the ſalvation of the Elect is certaine and ſure, and that they ſhall never periſh: according to the promiſe: <hi>no man ſhall plucke my ſheep of my hand. It is impoſsible the elect ſhould be ſeduced.</hi> All
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:96676:55"/>which ſerves, not for curioſitie, but for our comfort, that we being certaine of our ſalvation, might joyfullie perſevere in weldoeing unto the end.</p>
                     <p>Of infidels and reprobates two things are alſo ſpoken:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First</hi> that their names are not written in the booke of life: as appeares, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8.
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8</note> 
                        <hi>&amp;</hi> 17.8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20.15.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly:</hi> they are blotted out of the booke of life,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pſ.</hi> 69.28.</note> and caſt into the lake of fire: <hi>Let them be blotted out of the booke of the living, and not be written with the righteous.</hi> And, <hi>whoſoever was not found written in the booke of life, was caſt into the lake of fire,</hi> by which is ſignified, that they who are not predeſtinated ſhall certainlie periſh.</p>
                     <p>But this ſeems to imply a contradiction, as not to be written, &amp; yet to be blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out. I anſwer: that this is taken in a double ſence. 1: Eyther of ſuch who in the Eternal counſell of God are thus written, and ſo are never blotted out. Or, 2: according to the appearance, and boaſting of hypocrites: For thus they are ſaid to be blotted out: that is, declared never to have been written therein: we ſee there are many hypocrites in the Church, who are taken for a while to be the elect of God, whereas in truth they are not. Therfore when their hypocriſie is diſcovered, and they juſtlie caſt out of the church, then they are ſaid to be blotted out: As <hi>Ambroſe</hi> &amp; <hi>Auguſtine</hi> have wel obſerved.
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Matt.</hi> 24.24. <hi>Io.</hi> 10.28.</note> Not withſtanding it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not, that any of the Elect ſhalbe blotted out, For this is contrarie to that promiſe of God. <hi>It is impoſſible the Elect ſhould periſh, none ſhall plucke my ſheep out of my hand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This argument concerning our perſeverance is full of comfort: for all the faithfull, being elected, are written in the booke of life, and ſhall never be blotted out. Whoſoever therefore can now aſſure himſelf to be a beleever, ought cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly now to beleeve, that he is the choſen of God, and that he ſhall aſſuredlie perſevere in his faith, feare and ſervice for evermore: yet not by his owne ſtrength (for that were preſumption and repugnant unto faith) <hi>but by the power of God, who keepeth the elect through faith unto ſalvation,

<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.6. 1. <hi>Io.</hi> 5.20.</note> This is the true God, and eternall life:</hi> So here, <hi>theſe things ſaith he that is holy, he that is true.</hi> Thus we ſee, the divine majeſtie of Chriſt fully declared. Here alſo let us note the deteſtable boldneſſe of the <hi>Pope of Rome,</hi> who wil be called the <hi>moſt holy Father,</hi> yea <hi>holineſſe it ſelf:</hi> Is not this to lift himſelf up above Chriſt? doth he not herein manifeſt himſelf to bee the great Antichriſt.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt indeed is abſolutelie called the <hi>holy one:</hi> but the Pope calleth himſelf,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:96676:56"/>the <hi>moſt holy one</hi> and that abſolutely: Thus he proudly exalteth himſelf above Chriſt, which is proper to Antichriſt. The like we noted from the title of Chriſts prieſthood <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.14. where hee is twiſe called <hi>a great hie Prieſt.</hi> But the Pope arrogates to himſelf a higher title, viz. <hi>the greatest hie priest:</hi> wherein againe he lifteth himſelf up above Chriſt: and plainelie ſhewes that he is not his <hi>vicar,</hi> but rather the ſucceſſor of the Archprieſt of the Pagans, whom the Romans called <hi>Archflamins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But perhaps it will bee objected: That the Pope is called the greateſt hie Prieſt: not in reſpect of Chriſt, but of other inferior hie prieſts: and beeing the ſupreme and univerſall biſhop.</p>
                     <p>But this unlooſeth not the knot. For in what reſpect ſoever he calleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the <hi>greatest hie priest,</hi> it is evident that herein hee maketh himſelf greater then Chriſt, who is onely called the <hi>great hie priest:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This therefore confirmes what we ſaid before, that he was not Chriſts ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, but the <hi>Pagans priest:</hi> neyther will the pretence of other <hi>hie prieſts</hi> any whit helpe or credit them: for eyther they are not <hi>great hie prieſts,</hi> in reſpect of whome the Pope muſt bee ſaid to be the greateſt: or if they are, then they make themſelves equal with Chriſt, by aſſuming his proper title, and ſo are as ſacrilegious in this, as the Pope is in the other.</p>
                     <p>To bee ſhort the Pope in naming himſelfe the <hi>highest prieſt, univerſall bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, prince of prieſts,</hi> &amp;c. doth manifeſtly tranſgreſſe againſt their own Cannons diſt. 100. cap. <hi>Let not the Biſhop of the chiefe citie be called the prince, or chiefeſt of prieſts, or by any name tending this way, but onely the Biſhop of the firſt ſeat:</hi> againe: <hi>Let none of the Patriarcks uſe the name of univerſalitie: becauſe if any one of the Patriarks be called univerſall, how can there bee any more?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the Rubricke hath it: <hi>Let not the Biſhop of Rome be called univerſall.</hi> By this therefore he ſhewes himſelf to be Antichriſt indeed: for as <hi>Pope Gregorie</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth: <hi>Whoſoever calleth or deſireth to be called the univerſall Biſhop: is in this his ambition a forerunner of Antichriſt: in that hee proudly preferreth himſelf before the reſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Neither doth that helpe them which ſome vainly pretende, that the Pope takes not away the name or juriſdiction from other Biſhops: for eyther he makes himſelf alone univerſal, or els it muſt neceſſarilie follow, that every Church hath two at one time. But how ever it be, yet that <hi>of Gregorie</hi> is no way anſwered, but he is certainlie Antichriſt, who aſſumeth a ſuperioritie over his fellow mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Beza</hi> ſuppoſeth, that it might be read, <hi>the key of the howſe of David,</hi> as alluding to <hi>Jſay.</hi> 22.22. where the Lord promiſing to make <hi>Eliakim</hi> treaſurer in ſteed of <hi>Shebna</hi> ſaith, <hi>the key of the houſe of David will I lay upon his ſhoulder; ſo he ſhall open, and none ſhall ſhut, and he ſhall ſhut, and none ſhall open.</hi> The houſe of David, is the Church: the <hi>key</hi> is a ſigne of aeconomical power.</p>
                     <p>Now Chriſt hath this key, that is, abſolute power over the Church as Lord, and head thereof: and hath committed the miniſteriall power of the keyes, to the Apoſtles, and their ſucceſſors, which conſiſteth in opening and ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the kingdome of heaven by preaching of the Goſpel and adminiſtration of Church diſcipline.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Who openeth and no man ſhutteth</hi>] This notes a further degree of power, for he alone holdeth the key by his ſole and abſolute authoritie,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.18.</note> and ſo whatſoever he doth herein, he cannot be reſiſted: according to that in the Goſpel <hi>all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</hi>

But this ſeems to be a paradoxe, <hi>he openeth, and no man shutteth:</hi> how can this bee? the words ſeem to be taken from the place before cited. The meaning is, he onely hath right to open and to ſhut: but how is that? Some underſtand it of the ſence of the ſcripture, which to us is as a booke ſhut, unleſſe Chriſt by his ſpirit open our harts and underſtanding. This is true indeed in regard of one part of the ſentence, but to the other it anſwereth not: for howbeit Chriſt openeth the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereof, by enlightening of us: yet hee ſhuts them not, unleſſe it be by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that is, when he darkens ſuch more and more who are alreadie blind in the things of God. But I queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whither ſuch an expoſition appertaines to this place: For I rather thinke, it is ſpoken of Chriſts opening the dore of his Church, and of grace, and ſo conſequentlie of heaven it ſelf. And thus in the following verſes he is ſaid to open the dore of the church in <hi>Philadelphia:</hi> and the like he doth in all other places, when he calleth whomſoever he pleaſeth, and draweth them by his ſpirit: for none enter in at this dore, but ſuch unto whom Chriſt openeth the ſame.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And no man ſhutteth</hi>] For none can pluck Chriſts ſheep out of his hands; the gates of hel cannot ſhut this doore beeing once opened by him, neyther can any adverſarie power hinder them from entring into the ſame. The which matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is of ſingular comfort for his Church: for let Satan attempt what hee can, nevertheleſſe to whomſoever Chriſt openeth the doore, to them it ſhall ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine open and his ſheep ſhal have their egreſſe and regreſſe, and finde ſweet paſture for their ſoules: hence we ſee that the condition of the elect is ſafe and unchangeable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He shutteth and no man openeth</hi>] As he openeth and no man ſhutteth, ſo again on the contrarie, he by his mightie power ſhutteth, and no man is able to open. For whoſoever is not elected, called, and drawen by Chriſt, can never enter: for he is the <hi>doore,</hi> the <hi>way</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> Io. 10: which again proveth the Godhead of Chriſt: for to whom can theſe things be applied,

                        </note> except to God alone? ſome object, that this alſo was ſaid of <hi>Eliakim</hi> Iſay. 22. I anſwer, it was ſpoken of him typicallie, and in reſpect of his miniſterial power, as being a legal hie prieſt: but of Chriſt in regard of his kinglie, divine, and proper power, as being an eternall high-prieſt. The <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Roome</hi> to eſtabliſh his tyrannie, doth moſt impudently aſſume this power, which onely is proper to Chriſt: now Chriſt indeed gave power to <hi>Peter</hi> of binding and looſing, of opening and ſhutting, but it was by the key of the goſpel, and not to him alone, but unto all the Apoſtles, and Paſtors of the Churches. For as he ſaid to <hi>Peter,

So he ſaid unto the reſt, <hi>whatſoever yee ſhal binde on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven.</hi> Wheras the <hi>Pope</hi> alone wil open and ſhut all things as he pleaſeth, yet not by the key and power of the goſpel, but by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterate key of his owne Antichriſtian tyranny.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>I know thy workes, I have ſet before thee</hi>] The firſt part of the following nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is a commendation of the Paſtor and Church of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> for holding faſt the ſinceritie of the doctrine receyved againſt the haeriſies of the time: and remaining faithfull in their fierie trials.

But leaſt this holie teacher ſhould be lifted up, to thinke he did theſe things by his owne ſtrengeth: Chriſt therfore aſcribes both the firſt conſtitution of this Church, as alſo the conſtancie of Paſtor and people therin, to his grace alone: <hi>behold I have ſet before thee an open doore;</hi> that is, It is not by thy own power, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation over which thou art, embraceth the truth taught by thee, or that thou thy ſelf ſtandeſt faſt in the faith, againſt all the threats of the adverſaries, who dayly labour to ſhut this open doore: <hi>for thou haſt little strength,</hi> that is little, or no outward help and aſſiſtance: but it is <hi>I</hi> who have ſet an open doore before thee: It is <hi>I</hi> who have opened it by my own power, and hence the enemies nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have, nor ever ſhall be able to ſhut the ſame. Thus we ſe, that which before was indefinitely ſpoken of Chriſts ſhutting and opening: is here in perticular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the <hi>Philadelphians: J have ſet before thee an open doore.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I am not ignorant how theſe words, <hi>for thou haſt a little strength,</hi> may be taken in another ſence: And ſome indeed doe expound them adverſitivelie, as if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the greater commendation, for their conſtancie in their affliction, ſeing they had but a little ſtrength, that is deſtitute of humane protection. But then the cauſal <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>(for)</hi> ſhould bee a reaſon of the latter, that is, wherfore he had kept the word: which is repugnant to the ſcope of the commendation: for it is manifeſtly a reaſon of the former: namely wherfore Chriſt had opened a doore unto him, which no man ſhould bee able to ſhut.</p>
                     <p>Others again underſtand it as ſpoken for his comfort: as if Chriſt had ſaid, I have gathered unto my ſelf a Church in this citie in the midſt of many adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, over which I have appointed thee a Paſtor, and howſoever thou haſt but a little ſtrength to reſiſt them, notwithſtanding I will ſo protect both thee and thy congregation, as that no man ſhall bee able to ſhut, that is, to ſubvert the ſame, or expell the faithfull out of this place. Which interpretation I confeſſe containes much excellent comfort, both for the Paſtor and people: but conſidering that the Epiſtle as yet treates not of conſolations, I therfore allow rather the firſt expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
                     <p>Now touching this manner of ſpeech: <hi>An open doore,</hi> by a <hi>Metaphor</hi> is ſignified an occaſion offered of wel dooing; that is, an opportunitie of preaching and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating the Goſpel: for as a man goes into the houſe, the doore being opened: even ſo when the Lord gives paſſage to the Goſpel, Churches are planted &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated: according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>When I came to Troas to preach the Goſpel,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2, 12</note> a doore was opened to mee of the Lord:</hi> and 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.12. <hi>a great door and effectuall is opened to me</hi> &amp;c. Hence chiefly we are taught two things.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> this again proves the divinitie of Chriſt: for whereas he both knoweth the workes of the faithful, and openeth <hi>a doore</hi> to his Church, as alſo reſtraines the power of the adverſaries, that notwithſtanding all their malice and rage, yet can they not ſhut the ſame: it clearelie ſhewes that he is God onely wiſe and om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent. And therfore as Chriſt our Lord by his mightie workes,
<note place="margin">XXII <hi>Arg. of Chr. deity.</hi>

                     <p>The cavill of ſome hereticks is of no waight: who pretend that Chriſt doth theſe workes by a power communicated unto him of the father. I anſwer, he doth it by his divine and eſſentiall omnipotencie, which he hath received from the father by eternall generation: <hi>for whatſoever the father hath, is Chriſts,

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> as Chriſt of old opened <hi>a doore</hi> for the paſſage of the Goſpel, and no power of malice of men nor Devils could any way hinder the ſame: ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering at this day that among ſo manie enemies a doore is opened unto the Churches in <hi>Germanie, England, Poland, Hungarie</hi> &amp;c. we ought to acknowledge,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:96676:58"/>that this happeneth not by chance, nor aſcribe it to the induſtrie of teachers, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie of politicians, or the power of princes, but unto the grace, efficacie, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and power of Chriſt alone: for certainly the ſtrength of Chriſtians hath been little or nothing to reſiſt the tyrannical perſecution, cruell edicts, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible torments, by which Antichriſt hath laboured, (but in vain) utterlie to deface our Chriſtian faith: but by how much they have ſought to preſſe it downe, by ſo much (like unto the palme tree) it hath flouriſhed more and more: becauſe Chriſt by his divine power having opened this <hi>doore,</hi> Antichriſt was not able to ſhut the ſame. And indeed it is a thing admirable in our eyes: that ſome few <hi>Monkes</hi> and deſpiſed teachers ſhould by the contemptible preaching of the Goſpel, ſo ſhake the kingdome of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> howbeit ſupported with the aid and power of the kings and Emperors of the earth on all ſides, as that whole nations of the Chriſtian world ſhould turne from Antichriſt, to Chriſt our Lord.</p>
                     <p>Now this beeing come to paſſe, we may not thinke that either teachers, kings or princes have opened the <hi>doore:</hi> but becauſe Chriſt powerfullie reigning at the right hand of God, hath ſo effected the ſame: as that none was able to hinder it. Let us therfore bee truelie thankful unto Chriſt for ſo great a mercie and divine miracle, humbly beſeeching him to keep this doore ſtill open unto us, not ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it to be ſhut for our unthankfulnes, or his ſheep to be ſcattered by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: but that hee graciouſly preſerve his Churches by dwelling among them.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>And I wil make them of the Synagogue of Satan</hi>] Gr. <hi>I give them.</hi> The ſecond part is a conſolation, againſt two ſorts of temptations. <hi>The firſt,</hi> in this verſe: the ſecond, is expounded in the verſe following, by a cloſe <hi>Prolepſis,</hi> or prevention. For having ſaid, that he had ſet a <hi>doore open</hi> before them, which none ſhould ſhut: this might ſeeme impoſſible, conſidering how on the one ſide, the Iewes their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed enemies did much ennoy them: againe on the other hand how the unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving citizens, magiſtrates, togither with the kings and Romane Emperors did miſerably afflict them: yea and how Chriſt himſelfe foretels that they ſhould ſuffer yet greater troubles for his names ſake. Here then I ſay might they not doubt, how this doore ſhould be kept open by Chriſt againſt the adverſaries? and not rather in a ſhort time be ſhut up, that is, oppreſſed and deſtroyed by them.</p>
                     <p>To theſe feares hee oppoſeth diſtinct remedies, and to the end, that neither the Iewes perverſneſſe might offend them, nor the oppreſſion of tyrants diſmay them: Chriſt aſſures them that he will turne the one to their good, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them from the other. And this is the coherence, and ſum of theſe two verſes.</p>
                     <p>That which concernes the firſt temptation, is comprehended in theſe words, <hi>behold I give them of the Synagogue of Satan</hi> &amp;c. ſo he calleth the <hi>Jewes:</hi> as in cha. 2.9. <hi>I give,</hi> that is I rayſe up adverſaries againſt thee, who ſhal cruellie hate both thee, and the Church: for looke as the Iewes continually perſecuted the Apoſtles, by raiſing up againſt them tumults in all places, to hinder the propagation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: ſo would they doe unto theſe of <hi>Philadelphia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now to comfort them herein, Chriſt uſeth diverſe reaſons. <hi>Firſt,</hi> his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. <hi>I</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>give:</hi> that is, they ſhall not fall upon you by chance, but by my appointment, and to the end that yee ſhould be tryed, and therfore yee ought pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, to endure this temptation, and alwayes to truſt in mee: for I will give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but what ſhalbee for your good and profit. And thus I underſtand theſe words, howſoever others are otherwiſe minded. But doth not Chriſt in this make himſelf the author of ſinne? ſeeing the malice of theſe Iewes againſt the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians was verie ſinfull. I anſwer, it followeth not. For Chriſt rayſed up the Iewes againſt his ſervants, not putting this rage into them, but uſing them onelie for the others trial: as is expreſſed in the end of the following verſe: <hi>to try them that dwell upon the face of the earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the firſt conſolation, and ground of all the reſt. For he which beleeveth, that his troubles are ſent of God, wil bear them patiently, and aſſuredlie hope, that God wil turne all things unto his good.</p>
                     <p>

                        <hi>Who are of the Synagogue of Satan</hi>] A ſecond conſolation is taken from the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of their adverſaries: for they lyed in calling themſelves <hi>Jewes,</hi> that is, <hi>the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of God,</hi> deriving their name from <hi>Iudah,</hi> which ſignifies, <hi>to prayſe,</hi> as if they had been the ofſpring of <hi>Iuda,</hi> the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and onely people of God. But indeed they were not Iewes, but a <hi>Synagogue of Satan:</hi> ſe <hi>chap.</hi> 2.9. by which we are taught, not to admire by pocrites for the glorious titles, which they vainlie aſſume unto themſelves.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> to this day boaſt as beeing the <hi>Catholike Church:</hi> but they are a <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of Satan:</hi> becauſe they keep not the word of Chriſt: but perſecute it, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they pretend to the contrarie. For Chriſt ſaith: <hi>hee that beleeveth on wee, hath life everlasting:</hi> But they on the contrarie: not he that beleeveth in Chriſt, but hee that beleeveth the decrees of the Church of Rome and ſubjecteth himſelf unto the <hi>Pope,</hi> hee ſhall have life eternall.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Behold I wil make them to come, and worſhip before thy feet</hi>] The third conſolation is taken from the profitable event of their troubles: viz. the marveilous conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of theſe Iewes unto the faith of Chriſt. I will (ſaith hee) for a little while ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe thee, and the Church by theſe lying Iewes, but a while after I will convert them: ſuffer therfore their injuries patiently, for ſhortly they ſhall become your friends and bretheren.</p>
                     <p>Their converſion is deſcribed by theſe ſignes: <hi>they ſhall come and worſhip before thy feet:</hi> that is, in a humble manner deſire pardon for their offence: &amp; joyne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto your congregation. Hee ſpeakes not of that religious worſhip which is due unto God and Chriſt alone: but of an outward reverence, and falling downe before the feet of the paſtor and the whole Church in ſigne of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. For the word in the original <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <hi>(a dogge)</hi> and properlie ſignifies ſuch a manner of falling downe before the feet of any in ſigne of ſubjection, as whelps doe in fauning on their maſters: Metaphoricallie it is uſed for divine <hi>worſhip,</hi> or <hi>reverence,</hi> but here it is taken properlie.</p>
                     <p>Now behold the wonderful converſion of theſe Iewes, which yet is not to be aſcribed unto their owne free wil: for of themſelves they could not have repented: but this worke was wrought in them onely by the grace of Chriſt: for he ſaith, <hi>J will make them to come,</hi> which ſhewes the end or conſolatorie effect.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And to know that I have loved thee</hi>] That is, howſoever for the preſent they are your enemies and account you as men appointed to deſtruction: yet when they ſhalbe converted: they will bee of another minde, and know that I loved thee for thy patience and ſufferance. <hi>For I love them that love mee.</hi> Becauſe no man will ſuffer adverſitie for my names ſake, except he love mee.</p>
                     <p>Hence we may note two excellent doctrines.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> that we ought not to deſpaire of the ſalvation of our adverſaries. For it is eaſie with Chriſt of wolves to make them ſheep, of enemies friends: and therfore we ſhould always pray unto the Lord, for their converſion who are elected: we know there are twelve houres in the day, and that God cals ſome in the morning, ſome at noon, and ſome at evening, and then worketh ſuch an admirable change in their ſoules, as of perſecutors they become profeſſors, of a Synagogue of Satan, a Church and ſpouſe of Ieſus Chriſt: as we ſee in the knowen examples of <hi>Nobuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hadnezzer, Paul</hi> and others. Unto whom we may alſo adde theſe Iewes here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondlie,</hi> we ſe that the converſion of the wicked is not to be aſcribed unto any <hi>freewil</hi> in them: for Chriſt makes them to come and worſhip.

                        </gap>erie &amp; weaknes, which is come upon us by ſinne: as alſo of the great mercie of God towards us: for although indeed it may in ſome ſort be applied to our wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingned; that we come and worſhip: to others their unwillingnes, that they come not, but rather blaſpheme the name of Chriſt: yet the true and primarie cauſe,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:96676:59"/>which maketh us willing, wheras others in the mean time are left in their unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe, is the free mercie and grace of Chriſt, by which we are differenced and made better then others, according as it is here ſaid, <hi>I wil make them to come</hi> &amp;c.
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.18.</note> and again, <hi>who hath made thee to differ? for he hath mercie on whom he will have mercie, and whom he will he hardeneth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here fals in a queſtion how Chriſt makes us to come to worſhip. The <hi>Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> who plead for free-will, confeſſe indeed that this is a worke of grace, and without which no man can come: notwithſtanding they affirme, that a man before hee is in the ſtate of grace hath a free-wil to doe good, although weak and ſleepie: which <hi>will,</hi> (ſay they) by grace is awakened and ſtrengthened, and ſo it cooperates with grace, yea prevents it in the verie act of converſion, beeing as it were a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working cauſe: as when two horſes draw a chariot: or two men togither carie ſome waightie burden.</p>
                     <p>Moreover they affirme, that <hi>free-will</hi> is like a ſeeing man, who albeit in the darke he diſcernes nothing by reaſon of the indiſpoſition of the means, yet beeing brought into the light, he preſentlie diſcerneth every thing. So likewiſe they diſcourſe much, (though differing among themſelves) of the ſympathie or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betwixt grace, and the will.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Scotiſts</hi> will have grace to worke nothing on the will, but to have its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences on the effects. But the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> with <hi>Thomas</hi> affirme the contrarie, that grace workes upon the will, yet ſo as by an indifferent influence, and ſo is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from it, according as the will is eyther good or evill.</p>
                     <p>But herein they all agree: that grace is onelie perſwaſive, ſuch as is the motion of Orators unto their auditorie, unto which the will, if it will, eyther doth, or doth not give efficacie and entertainment:

                     </p>
                     <p>Now on the contrarie the ſcripture teacheth, that the naturall man lies dead in ſinne, and is like unto an <hi>Ethiopian</hi> who cannot change his ſkin, or a <hi>Leopard</hi> which cannot caſt off his ſpots: hee receives not the things of the ſpirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſſe unto him: <hi>Everie imagination of the thought of his heart is onely evil continually:</hi>

And therfore ſeeing that ſuch is the corruption of our will and faculties, as that it is Chriſt, who makes us to come unto him, and the Father drawes unto Chriſt: none can affirme that the grace of converſion is onely an indifferent influence, or m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>But they further object, that <hi>free-will</hi> makes man to differ from the beaſt that periſheth, and therfore ſin could not take it away without the deſtruction of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wherby man ſhould become an unreaſonable creature.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I anſwer:</hi> It is true, if it be meant of free-will abſolutely. But what is that to the purpoſe: we deny not free-will abſolutely, for without it a man ſhould bee no more a man, but a verie beaſt. But we deny that a natural man hath a free and underſtanding will unto that which is good, in things appertaining to God: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſcripture in this pronounceth man blinde, and a ſervant to that which is evil, yea to be dead in ſinnes, and altogither diſobedient unto God. And therfore that we may come unto Chriſt wee have need not onely of perſwaſive motions, but alſo of an effectuall worke of grace, by which the Lord illuminateth, draweth, and regenerateth us, that ſo we may become new creatures: but what need have we to uſe many words: the ſum of all is this: The natural man is dead in ſin, and God gives us both the will, and the deed: Chriſt makes us to come unto him, what now is there left unto free will? they therfore which eſtabliſh it againſt grace, doe rob God and Chriſt of their honour: precipitate man by pride into extreem dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and renew the herifie of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> whatſoever they pretend to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie.</p>

10. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt kept the word of my patience</hi>] Now he comforts him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the perſecutions at hand; of which wee might diſcourſe, more fullie, if we had, the hiſtories of the Church of thoſe times.

<note place="margin">

                     <p>This conſolation is alſo threefold. The <hi>firſt</hi> is an approbation of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie in their former afflictions: <hi>becauſe thon haſt kept my word.</hi> It is a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort unto us, to hear, that our actions are approved of by men: but we ought much more to rejoyce if God approve thereof: for this worketh in us an aſſurance of a good conſcience, and of the goodneſſe of the cauſe for which we ſuffer: as ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring not as evil doers, but as Chriſtians. He calleth the doctrine of the Goſpel, <hi>the word of his patience,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> cals it the <hi>word of the croſſe,</hi> becauſe we muſt take up the croſſe of Chriſt, and ſuffer afflictions patientlie for the profeſſion therof. He cals it <hi>his patience, or ſufferance</hi> becauſe he firſt ſuffered, beeing an example unto all them that beleeve in him: for <hi>through manifold tribulations we muſt enter into the kingdome of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And I will deliver thee</hi>] a ſecond conſolation, is a promiſe of deliverance <hi>in the houre of temptation,</hi> that is, of affliction, which figuratively is called the temptation of the Godly. Now hope of deliverance out of evil cauſeth conſtancie: becauſe <hi>hope maketh not aſhamed.</hi> Unto this <hi>hope</hi> we are ſtirred up, by laying hold on the promiſes of God concerning our certaine deliverance: which the Lord not onely promiſeth here unto this teacher, but unto all ſuch as are in the like temptation, that is, unto all the ſaintes diſperſed throughout the whole earth. And therefore it teacheth us to be conſtant in the day of tryal, &amp; to expect a ful, and perfect free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome by Chriſt our Lord.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But</hi> this ſeemeth to eſtabliſh the doctrine of merits, ſeeing Chriſt promiſeth deliverance, becauſe we keep his word. I anſwer: when the ſcriptures ſpeake of <hi>workes</hi> &amp; <hi>reward,</hi> they uſually thus expreſſe it, as, <hi>becauſe thou haſt don this, I will multiply thy ſeed.</hi> Now we are to know, that this argues no mercenary reward due for deſert ſake: But a fatherly (though undeſerved promiſe, annexed unto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our obedience: For no man can be ſaid to merit in dooing that which he is bound to performe: but we are injoyned <hi>to keep the word of Christ:</hi> and beſides when we have don the utmoſt that we can, yet we are but unprofitable ſervants: &amp; God doth onely of his free grace reward our obedience &amp; conſtancy. So that the ſpeech of Chriſt in this place, is not an argument drawen from the meritorious cauſe of ſalvation, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the condition onely without which we cannot exſpect the ſame: for Chriſt promiſeth to deliver none, but ſuch as keep his word. Why then doth he thus ſpeak? not that we ſhould be lifted up with an opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of merit: but by promiſing a reward, hee ſheweth how acceptable our obedience is unto him: as alſo to the end that we may increaſe &amp; perſevere in grace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>From the houre of temptation</hi>] The third conſolation is contained in theſe words; <hi>temptation,</hi> that is, the cruel perſecution of <hi>Trajane,</hi> or ſome other tyrant: in calling it an <hi>houre</hi> he noteth the brevity of this affliction, that they might the more cheerfully undergoe it. The croſſe is compared to a womans ſorrow in travel. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.20. becauſe of the ſhortneſſe of the paine, and the joyfull effect thereof.

                     <p>
                        <hi>To try them that dwel upon the earth</hi>] the fourth conſolation is taken from the uſe of afflictions: They are not ſent as puniſhments from God for our deſtruction: but for the trial of our faith and conſtancie. And in this reſpect they are, <hi>first</hi> juſt: becauſe God hath right to trie us: and 2: neceſſarie,

For by it the ungodlineſſe, in conſtancy, &amp; lightneſſe of the former is made manifeſt, God hereby ſeparating hypocrites, &amp; wicked men crept into the Church from the ſociety of ſaintes: for theſe remaine conſtant, the other by their apoſtacie manifeſt the ſecret cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of their hearts. Moreover we are to take notice, that theſe words <hi>them that dwell upon the earth,</hi> are alwayes in this booke taken in a bad ſence, as ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying unfound men, idolaters, &amp; the followers of Antichriſt; as will appear in the following hyſtorie.</p>
                     <p n="11">11 <hi>Behold, I come quickly</hi>] This may be referred to the following exhortation. I will come quickly, hold faſt therefore that treaſure of faith, which thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. But it ſeemes rather to agree with that which went before, as a concluſion of the third conſolation: promiſing to come quickly to deſtroy the wicked, &amp; to deliver his children, leaſt by delaying their deliverance they might ſeeme to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient. Some referre this to his laſt coming. If ſo, then <hi>quickly,</hi> notes not the time at hand: but ſooner then the world is aware of. For although the Lord be not yet come,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9.</note> 
                        <hi>yet he is not ſlack,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>concerning his promiſe, but is long ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to uſward, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance.</hi> He will therfore <hi>come quicklie,</hi> that is, ſooner then many thinke. <hi>For when the world ſhall ſay, peace and ſafety, then ſudden deſtruction commeth.</hi> See <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.1.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hold that fast, which thou hast</hi>] In this third part of the narration, he exhorts them, to ſincerity, and conſtancy in the faith, that they looſe not the reward: And it is added to the foregoing conſolation, leaſt by it we ſhould become ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure. The ſentence is brief, but very emphatical. <hi>Hold faſt that which thou haſt.</hi> What had they? faith and a good conſcience, as <hi>Paul</hi> expounds it: 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.18. And indeed theſe are the chief heads of all ſpirituall bleſſings, the which whoſoever hath, and keepes in this life, ſhall obtaine a crowne of glory in the life to come. Theſe two, the Paſtor and Church of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> had, and with them all other graces. For <hi>by faith,</hi> they had righteouſnes, ſanctification, adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and hope of glorie to come. <hi>By a good conſcience</hi> they increaſed in ſincerity, patience, and conſtancie under the croſſe: as we have alreadie ſhewed: <hi>Theſe things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hold faſt,</hi> to wit, <hi>unto the end.</hi> The word (<gap reason="foreign">

Thus this crowne is diſtinguiſhed from thoſe other crownes, which in ancient times were given unto conquerours. <hi>See our Commentarie on</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.24.</p>
                     <p>We may here obſerve manie things, the which I will breifly touch.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> we are taught, that the promiſes of God, ought not to make us ſecure, but rather to ſtirre up our indeavour to conſtancie: for we cannot aſſuredly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie them unto our ſelves, except we earneſtly labour to performe our duty. Chriſt promiſed indeed to this Church, <hi>to keepe them from the houre of temptation:</hi> yet he bids them hold faſt what they had: intimating, that our faith and conſtancie
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:96676:60"/>ought not to be leſſened by the promiſes, but rather ſtrengthened and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                     <p>Secondlie, we are taught, that they onely ſhall be crowned with the promiſed reward in heaven, who hold faſt what they have here receyved: <hi>we ſhall be cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed upon with our houſe which is from heaven:
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.3.</note> if ſo bee that beeing cloathed we ſhall not bee found naked.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdlie, ſeeing it is called, <hi>thy crowne:</hi> it ſeems to denote, that in heaven we ſhall have every one his owne crowne: from whence it may be gathered, that as there are degrees of puniſhment: ſo there ſhall bee differences of reward, yea un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedlie ſuch faithfull teachers, as have brought manie to righteouſnes:
<note place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iovinian</hi> againſt whom <hi>Ierome</hi> diſputeth, ſeems to hold that all the faithfull ſhall have one and the like degree of glorie: the which alſo ſome orthodoxe teachers to this day doe maintaine, grounding their opinion on the words of Chriſt, <hi>The juſt ſhall ſhine as the ſunne:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Matt.</hi> 13.43.</note> whoſe brightneſſe ſurpaſſeth the bewtie of all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Now however this be granted, yet we may ſafely conclude a degree of glorie, ſeeing that even the ſun appears unto us, ſome time more, and ſome time leſſe in brightneſſe. And I beleeve, <hi>Jovinian</hi> did not denie a degree abſolutely, but denied the ſame in reſpect of merit. The which we ſhould underſtand more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, were his bookes now extant: howbeit we may probablie gather ſo much from the very reaſons and grounds laid down by <hi>Hierom</hi> himſelf.</p>
                     <p>In the laſt place we ſee, that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this life ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> come to that perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or fulnes, or is ſo nigh unto the kingdome of God, but that he might be deprived thereof, in caſe he ſhould be left unto himſelf, or be careles: that is, continues not faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in weldoeing. And therfore we are admoniſhed,

                        <hi>If we ſtand to take heed least we fall: and though we ſtand by faith, yet not to be high minded but fear.</hi> But if ſo be, that ſome of the faithfull may let go their hold, and looſe the crowne: where then is that <hi>(plerophoria)</hi> or full aſſurance of our ſalvation, and perſeverance of the elect, of which Chriſt ſpeaketh: <hi>No man ſhall take my ſheep out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>I anſwer: however Libertines and Sophiſters doe hence draw ſuch a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, yet it followes not: For as <hi>Austin</hi> from this very place proveth, the number of the elect is certaine, and can neither be augmented, or diminiſhed. <hi>For,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if one receives it not, except another looſe it, then the number is certaine. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though theſe things are spoken unto the ſaintes who perſevere, as though it were uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine whither they ſhould ſtand or not: nevertheles it onely teacheth, that we ſhould not be wiſe above that which is meet, but fear.</hi> We are moreover to conſider, that as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, ſo the exhortation, is directed not onely to the paſtor, but alſo unto the whole Church, in which there is alwayes a mixture of ſaintes and hypocrites, of elect, and reprobates, who indeed with the mouth make confeſſion of faith, but beleeve not <hi>with the</hi> heart unto righteouſneſſe; and therfore are ſaid to be deprived of the crowne, becauſe they hold not faſt that which they have, that is, that which they ſeem to have. According to that in <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.18. <hi>Whoſoever hath not, from him ſhall be taken, even that which hee ſeemeth to have.</hi> And therefore, when ſuch fall away, and looſe the crowne, it nothing weakens the ſtate of election:
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.19</note> for as the Apoſtle witneſſeth, they are not in the number of the elect: <hi>they went out from us, but they were not of us: for if they had beene of us, they would no doubt have continued with us,</hi> &amp;c. Vnto them therefore that of the Apoſtle is to be applyed. <hi>Let him which ſeems to ſtand take heed least he fall, thou ſtandest by faith be not high minded but feare:</hi> which threatnings are manifeſtly ſpoken of highminded hypocrites, ſuch as ſtand in outward appearance onely. But the ſalvation of the elect is ſure, becauſe they are kept by the power of God through faith, and in humilitie of minde, they ſhall certainely hold faſt, that which they have, and never be caſt off.</p>

                        <pb n="72" facs="tcp:96676:61"/>
But you will ſay; if this Biſhop, (as undoubtedly he was) were one of the elect: what need then was there of this threatning, <hi>that no man take thy crowne:</hi> ſeeing the elect cannot fall away, or be deprived thereof?</p>
                     <p>I anſwer; It is not in vaine. <hi>Firſt,</hi> though indeed the elect cannot looſe the crowne in reſpect of the decree of God, by which they are predeſtinated, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto ſalvation, yet might it be taken away in reſpect of their owne infirmitie, if they were left unto themſelves, and in reſpect of other cauſes alſo which threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten their deſtruction, except they were preſerved by that <hi>power</hi> of which Peter ſpeaketh: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5.</p>
                     <p>Secondlie, theſe threatnings as they reſpect the faithfull, are conditional. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall take their crowne, if they perſevere not in the faith: but they doe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere. 1: Becauſe God keeps them unto the end. 2: Becauſe Chriſt doth conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuallie pray for them, that their faith faile not: And 3: becauſe they themſelves always pray for the ſame,
<note place="margin">

Vnto all which we may adde the teſtimonies of <hi>Thomas, Hierom, Bede, Haimo,</hi> and others whom <hi>Ribera</hi> citeth. See <hi>Bell. Caſtigatum lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Grat.

                        <hi>Him that overcommeth</hi>] In the concluſion a reward of victorie is promiſed unto the ſpiritual champions, who warre under Chriſts banner, and to the ſame is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed the common <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> wherin as formerlie, the diligent conſideration of this Epiſtle is recommended unto them. The ſeverall rewards mentioned, doe il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate the excellencie of the crowne propoſed.</p>
                     <p>Now it is propounded unto all, yea even unto us if we overcome: which thing we doe, when we keep faith and a good conſcience, and perſevere conſtantly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the croſſe in the word of God. And this is the onely way to overcome, but cannot be effected, without great labour in reſiſting oppoſing, and putting to flight all enemies whatſoever. Such therfore as eyther fight not at all, or els doe it ſlacklie, or perfidiouſly fall away, they neyther overcome, nor obtaine the crowne of life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo unto them theſe promiſes doe not appertaine. Let us ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in conſideration hereof, conſtantly fight the battels of the Lord. And ſo we come to treat of the rewards, which are cleare in themſelves, though metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally propounded in a threefold promiſe.</p>

                     <p>The Apoſtles are called <hi>pillars</hi> of the Church militant, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.9. &amp; <hi>foundation</hi> thereof, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20. not as ſuſtaining the Church (for that is proper to Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone) but as choiſe inſtruments in Gods hand, by whom he founded, preſerved, &amp; propagated the ſame. Others ſuppoſe the phraſe to be taken from the cuſtome of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who uſed to ſet up <hi>pillars,</hi> that is, trophees and images of honour: now in this ſence it might be taken, but that Chriſt ſaith not, <hi>I will ſet him up as a pillar,</hi> but <hi>I will make him a pillar.</hi> But it is more probable that he alludeth to the two <hi>brazen pillars</hi> ſet up by <hi>Solomon</hi> in the porch of the temple, which typified the ſtability of the children of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And he ſhall goe no more out</hi>] This is the ſecond promiſe: it ſhall not bee a momentanie glorie, but unchangeable perpetuall and eternall. And it ſeemes to be put heere in oppoſition to thoſe <hi>brazen pillars,</hi> which were overthrowen with the temple by the Babylonians: but no ſuch deſtruction ſhall befal the godly, for as the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> ſpeaketh,

<note place="margin">An inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of a threefold name.</note> is an inſcription of a threefold name, viz. of God, of the citie of God, and of Chriſt. He ſeemes eyther to allude to the manner of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> who uſed to write on their <hi>ſtatues of triumph</hi> the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Conquerours, the titles and names of conquered nations: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: <hi>To Tyberius: To Conſtantine alwayes Auguſtus: To the Conquerour of Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi> of the <hi>Gothes,</hi> of <hi>Africa</hi> &amp;c.

Well how ever it be, certaine it is, that both theſe <hi>pillars</hi> with their names were deſtroyed: the vain inſcriptions of the Romanes periſhed: but the names which Chriſt will write upon his pillars, they ſhall remaine for ever and ever.</p>
                     <p>Firſt he will write upon them, <hi>the Name of his God</hi>] not that theſe conquerours ſhalbe Gods: but the ſons of God, that is, perfectly borne againe after the image of God: Indeed we are now Gods children by faith: but theſe glorious inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons here promiſed, doe not yet appeare, namely, the full fruition and majeſtie of our adoption.</p>

Chriſt calleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the <hi>Amen,</hi> from the Hebrew <hi>Aman,</hi> veritie: It is an affirmative particle, and caries with it the nature of an oath, confirming the truth, and certainty of things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is in greeke <hi>nai</hi> (yea) in Latine <hi>certe, profecto,</hi> verely, verely.

                     <p>Chriſt therefore is the <hi>Amen,</hi> the true and faithfull witneſſe, becauſe as he is God, ſo he is truth it ſelf, and the eſſentiall wiſedome of the <hi>Father.</hi> And as he is man, he hath witneſſed and brought forth the teſtimony of the goſpell out of the boſome of his father, and by divine miracles ſo confirmed the truth thereof as that none but with great impiety can queſtion the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Now the reaſon why here he calleth himſelf thus, ſeems to bee, becauſe he had to doe with hypocrites, who beeing growen ſecure, began to eſteem of the faith of Chriſt as a thing indifferent, &amp; that for the cauſe thereof they needed not to contend with the Pagans, or ſuffer affliction for the ſame. Now Chriſt to the end that he might more plainlie take them for their lukewarmeneſſe, doth by theſe epithites declare his truth and faithfulneſſe. The reaſon wherefore Chriſt is called <hi>Amen,</hi> is ſhewed by the Apoſtle 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.19. where he ſaith, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched among the Corinthians was not yea, and nay,</hi> that is, variable and inconſtant: <hi>becauſe in him all the promiſes of God,</hi> even from the infancie of Church, unto this day, are <hi>Yea, and Amen,</hi> that is, ſurely and certainely fulfilled, <hi>unto the glory of God the Father.</hi> The which as it the ſerves to refute their folly, who eyther call in queſtion, or reject the faith of Chriſt, as doe the <hi>Turks, Jewes, Epicures, Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,</hi> and others: ſo it doth very much comfort, and ſtrengthen the faith of the godlie.

                        <hi>(juſt).</hi> But thou, ſaith Chriſt, art neyther <hi>cold,</hi> nor <hi>hote.</hi> Interpreters are diverſly minded about ſuch as are ſaid to be <hi>hot, cold,</hi> or <hi>luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warine: Alcaſar</hi> brings in eleven opinions, but he ſeeks a knot in a ruſh. The thing it ſelf plainely ſhewes, that Chriſt by a proverbiall metaphor accounts him to be neyther <hi>hot,</hi> nor <hi>cold,</hi> but <hi>lukewarme,</hi> who neyther is a profeſſed enemy of the Goſpel, nor yet a faithfull profeſſor thereof, but an hypocrite: that is one as it were betwixt both; And it may be referred eyther to their life, or doctrine. As for the mixture of heatheniſh, and Iewiſh rites in the ſervice of God, it began firſt to increaſe immediately upon the ceſſation of the perſecution of the Romane Emperors, and when the Chriſtian Church began to enjoye eaſe and tranquillity. And therefore I judge that theſe <hi>Laodiceans</hi> were not as yet guiltie of this evill, but they were lukewarme, as concerning faith and manners, in complying with the gentiles, to the end that beeing the leſſe offenſive unto them, they might quietly enjoy their trade in that noble mart-towne which abounded with all ſorts of merchants: for however they deſired to be accounted good Chriſtians, yet did they not forſake their former frande and luxurie. The ſumme of all is this, They mingled Chriſt, and the world togither, and made uſe of religion, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then might ſtand with their profit and trade. Thus they were neither open enemies to Chriſt, nor yet his true friends: but as it were <hi>lukewarme</hi> and <hi>neutrals,</hi> that is, fained and lying hypocrites, and ſoo worſe in Chriſts eſteem then his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed enemies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I would thou wert eyther hot or cold</hi>] He wiſheth they were <hi>hot,</hi> that is truely zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in faith and godlineſſe: for the law requireth, <hi>that men ſhould love the Lord with all their hart, and with all their ſoul,</hi> &amp;c. Thus we ſee that to be <hi>hot,</hi> is to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in hart, ful of love to God and our neighbour.</p>
                     <p>Now Chriſt wiſheth they were <hi>cold,</hi> that is, altogither without faith and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, not abſolutely, but comparatively, in aſmuch as they who are <hi>cold</hi> ſeem to be more excuſable, then ſuch as are <hi>lukewarme,</hi> and more eaſily to be reformed, &amp; better avoyded then others, and in this reſpect are leſſe hurtfull then they. For the ſin of hypocrites is greater then theirs who are open enemies: becauſe it is a worſe thing not to follow the truth in ſincerity which we know, then to be ignorant altogether thereof: for ſuch are more eaſily wrought upon by the means, and ſooner brought to the truth: wheras hypocrites having faith onely in ſhew, doe imagine they ſee, but are blinde, and mantaine their falſe opinions, hating &amp; perſecuting in the mean time the truth of God.</p>
                     <p>For example, the <hi>Lutherans</hi> who beeing wedded to their falſe opinions, are the more hardlie drawen from them. For they hate and perſecute the orthodoxe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine concerning our ſpirituall communion with Chriſt, more then the blinde Papiſts: Againe a Iew who is a profeſſed enemie of Chriſt, will eaſier be brought to embrace chriſtian religion, then an hypocriticall Ieſuite, drowned in Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſuperſtitions. And therefore with great reaſon Chriſt wiſheth, that this Church were rather <hi>cold</hi> then <hi>lukewarme:</hi> not that it is good to be cold, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a lukewarme condition is more dangerous and hurtfull then the other. We ſee alſo in natural things (from whence the metaphor is taken) that hot or cold things are more approved, then thoſe things that are lukewarme. Hot meats in cold weather, and cold drinkes in hot ſeaſons agree beſt with the ſtomack: but that which is lukewarme, is lothſome, and diſpoſeth to vomit.</p>
                     <p>Hence Chriſt deſired that the Phariſees had been blinde rather then hypocrites, who are uncapable of reproofe.

                        <hi>I will ſpue thee out of my mouth</hi>] Here we ſe the lenity and patience of Chriſt, in bearing a long time with hypocrites: yea inviting of them unto repentance, &amp; preadmoniſhing them of their puniſhment, before he ſpues them out for their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacie. Gods threatnings therfore are to be underſtood conditionally: I <hi>will ſpue thee out,</hi> viz. If thou repent not.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Out of my mouth</hi>] Here it will not follow that ſuch as are <hi>cold,</hi> are in Chriſts mouth, or that any of the faithfull may fall from grace: As <hi>Ribera</hi> ſubtilly diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth. For Chriſt threatens this, not againſt the <hi>cold,</hi> but the lukewarme, who by profeſſion and appearance are in his <hi>mouth,</hi> that is, in the Church of Chriſt: but indeed are hypocrites, having a forme of godlines, but denie the power thereof.</p>
                     <p>But hence we ought rather to obſerve, that there are allwayes many hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites in the boſome of the Church, and eſpecially among the Clergie: this mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture therfore ſhould not offend us (for the divell wil alwayes ſow tares among the wheat) neyther ought we to be moved with the loftie titles of <hi>hie-prieſts, cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, arch-biſhops, biſhops, prelates,</hi> and the like rabble of Antichriſt.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, I anſwer with Ierom, that <hi>parables, and the expoſition of darke ſentences, are not to be brought for the confirmation of doctrines.</hi> Now all this is ſpoken allegorically, and by an <hi>anthropopatheia,</hi> and not properly: for wheras Chriſt is ſaid, <hi>to knocke</hi> like a traveller at the <hi>doore,</hi> and to <hi>ſup</hi> with them that open:

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> the conſequence will not hold from what is conditional to the thing categorically required. As, <hi>If any man heare, and open:</hi> therefore it ſhould follow, that it is in our free-will to doe the ſame.

                     </p>
                     <p>The throne which he ſaw is alſo ſpoken of Chap. 1. v. 4. and mentioned eight and twentie times in this booke: and hereby is repreſented the dominion and judgement of God over all things, whereof he will have us to be alwayes mindfull.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A lasper</hi>] There are diverſe ſorts of this ſtone, as <hi>Plinie lib.</hi> 37. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. and <hi>Iſidor. cap.</hi> 6. <hi>lib.</hi> 7. doe affirme: and it is thought that the Indian <hi>Iasper</hi> called <hi>Polygrammos,</hi> is the beſt of them, beeing greene, cleare, and ſomewhat like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an <hi>Emerauld:</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> is like to braſſe: that of <hi>Cypria</hi> is of a blewiſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and the <hi>Phrigian</hi> ſomewhat reddiſh: that which is found in <hi>Thracia</hi> is much like unto the <hi>Indian:</hi> but the <hi>Chalcidonian</hi> is leſſe beautifull then any of them. <hi>Plinie</hi> writeth that he ſaw one of eleven ounces in waight, on which was ingraven the image of <hi>Neroes</hi> breaſtplate. It is thought that this ſtone is a ſingular preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive againſt all manner of deadly poyſon, and withall hath manie other vertues in it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sardine</hi>] in latine <hi>Sardius,</hi> but <hi>Plinie</hi> calleth it <hi>Sarda,</hi> which is white in colour,

                     <p>
                        <hi>Emerauld</hi>] This is a moſt pleaſant Germme, green of colour, and very delightful to the ſight: the <hi>Scythian</hi> ſtone is the moſt pretious, although the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> and <hi>Brittiſh</hi> alſo (as <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> witneſſeth) are of great worth. They write that <hi>Nero</hi> beheld his fencers at their game through an <hi>Emerald.</hi> It drives away poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, preſerves chaſtitie, ſtrengthens the memorie, and helpeth the ſight, &amp;c. Like to this ſtone, he ſaw about the throne <hi>a rainbow,</hi> which we ſee commonlie to be of white, yellow and greene colour. It is probable that this viſion cheifly alludes unto the pretiouſneſſe of theſe ſtones. For whatſoever is eyther pretious or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, al is to be found fully and perfectly in him that ſits on the throne. Some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the <hi>Iaſper</hi> and <hi>Sardine,</hi> of the two natures of Chriſt. The <hi>Jaſper</hi> which is greene refreſhing the eyes, they attribute to Chriſts divinity: &amp; the <hi>Sardine,</hi> which is red, unto his humanity: like as his fleſh was red in the blood of his paſſion. The <hi>rainbow</hi> they will have to bee a ſigne of his grace, alluding to that in <hi>Geneſis,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.13.</note> where God is ſaid <hi>to ſet his bowe in the cloude</hi> for a token of his covenant. Whence they conclude, that this <hi>rainbow</hi> like unto an <hi>Emerald,</hi> doth ſignifie Gods everlaſting mercie, which is green, that is, never fadeth away. But ſuch kinde of allegories, do ſerve little or nothing at all for our inſtruction.</p>
                     <p>If it bee demanded who he ſaw ſitting on the throne. I anſwer, that without all doubt God is here repreſented: for it is expreſly called the <hi>Throne of God</hi> chap. 7.15. and 12.5. &amp; chap. 19.4. Notwithſtanding interpreters are diverſly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded about it. <hi>Lyra</hi> underſtands it of one God, three in perſons: appearing on the throne after this manner, as beeing the governour &amp; king of the Church militant, &amp; judge of the whole world. Others expound it of the perſon of the father alone. But we may ſafely underſtad it abſolutely of God ſitting &amp; reigning in the perſon of the ſon, to whom the father hath given all judgment; he therfore who is ſaid here to ſit on the throne, is the ſamewho before gloriouſly walked in the midſt of the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:96676:69"/>
                        <hi>ſeven candleſticks,</hi> namely Chriſt the ſon of God. And this doth plainlie appeare from v. 8. &amp; 9. where two Epithites aſcribed Chap. 1. v. 8. &amp; 18. as proper unto Chriſt (to wit, <hi>he which was, which is, and which is to come,</hi> and again, <hi>he that liveth for evermore</hi>) are here attributed to him that ſits on the throne. The like we may gather, from Chap. 21.6. where he that ſits on the throne cals himſelf α and ο, <hi>the beginning &amp; ending, who giveth to him that is a thirſt, of the fountain of the water of life.</hi> but Chriſt calleth himſelf α and ο, chap. 1.8. And in Ioh. 4.14. &amp; 7.37. we are taught, that it is he, who gives to them that are a thirſt, to drinke of the water of life: to be ſhort both the <hi>Ordinary Gloſſe,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Catholike gloſſe,</hi> of <hi>Marloratus,</hi> interpret this of Chriſt, the Lord of the Church: neither doth the reaſon hereof ſeem to be obſcure. For the ſame, whom before he ſaw walking among the candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks as Lord on earth: he now ſees him, ſitting as Iudge in heaven.</p>
                     <p>That which may bee objected concerning the <hi>Lambe,</hi> ſeems not to take away what wee have ſaid: for there is no abſurditie in this, that Chriſt ſhould bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented unto Iohn under diverſe figures in a diverſe reſpect. Before he ſaw him walking among the candleſticks, as the head of the Church: Now he ſees him ſitting on the throne, as the Iudge of the world, and alſo as it were a Lambe ſlaine, and made a ſacrifice for us. Thus alſo the Apoſtle to the Hebrewes makes Chriſt both high-prieſt, and ſacrifice, and Altar in a diverſe reſpect. Neyther are we to imagine, that Chriſt the ſon ſo ſits on the throne, as if the Father were put by, for it is the Father which giveth unto the ſon to ſit on his throne, as it hath been ſhewed Chap.

Let them who will make uſe of this interpretation. But neither <hi>Ribera,</hi> nor my ſelf do approve thereof. <hi>Alcaſar</hi> alſo judgeth, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee applied, but with violence unto the ſacrament of Baptiſme. <hi>Andreas Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarienſis</hi> underſtandeth it of the multitude of Angels, and heavenlie powers. Others ſuppoſe it hath an alluſion unto Solomons <hi>brazen ſea:</hi> and that the materiall alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of braſſe, into glaſſe which one may ſee through, doth denote the difference betwixt the <hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>Goſpell:</hi> but theſe allegories will not hold. The inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation therefore of <hi>Ribera</hi> is more probable, applying it to the multitude of men living on the earth: who are compared to the ſea of ſhining glaſſe: becauſe the ſea is a gathering of many waters, by which peoples and nations are ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, Chap. 12.15. and they are ſhining, becauſe the counſels and the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret

                        <hi>Bullinger</hi> before <hi>Ribera</hi> is yet more cleare. <hi>The ſea,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>before the Throne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling glaſſe and Chryſtall in brightnes and perſpicuity, ſignifies this fraile world, which is allwayes in Gods ſight. For the holie ſcriptures doe type out unto us by the ſea (in regard, of its inſtabilite noyſe and tumultuouſnes) the mutability and inconſtancie of this preſent world: the ſtate thereof beeing more fraile then glaſſe.</hi> This expoſition I well approve of, as beeing indeed moſt probable: As for <hi>Alcaſars</hi> fiction in applying it unto his deviſed ſacrament <hi>of Confeſſion,</hi> it is both a violent and a falſe wreſting of the text. So then the <hi>ſea,</hi> ſignifies the world, which is ſaid, to be before the throne, becauſe the ſame ſhalbe judged by Chriſt. The world indeed doth ſwell &amp; rage againſt the ſaintes: but it is as fraile as <hi>glaſſe</hi> or <hi>Chryſtall,</hi> whoſe waves are eaſilie broken, and held in by the powerfull hand of the Lord. Now this thing is here inſerted, both for the comfort of <hi>John</hi> and the whole Church. In this ſence alſo, and for the ſame end it is ſaid in <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.8. <hi>the great mountaine burning with fire was caſt into the ſea:</hi> &amp; <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.2. they that had overcome the beaſt, are ſaid to <hi>ſtand upon the ſea of glaſſe,</hi> of which more in its place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And in the midſt of the throne</hi>] The fourth apparition about the throne, are the <hi>foure</hi> beaſts, differing in forme, but having eyes before and behinde, and each of them ſixe wings: Alluding to the <hi>foure beaſts</hi> in <hi>Ezechiel Chap.</hi> 1. And therefore ancient and moderne writers for the moſt part,
<note place="margin">Whither the foure beaſts type out the foure E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts.</note> underſtand by them the <hi>foure Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists,</hi> which are commonlie expreſſed, and painted in theſe formes: <hi>Matthew,</hi> in the likeneſſe of a <hi>man: Mark</hi> of a <hi>Lyon: Luke</hi> of an <hi>Oxe:</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>a flying Eagle. Irenaeus</hi> applies it to the <hi>foure Goſpels.</hi> But <hi>Lyra</hi> refutes this, from the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der here obſerved: becauſe the face of a man, appropriated to <hi>Matthew,</hi> is here put in the third place, he therefore here underſtands the foure Patriarchal Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, viz. <hi>Hieruſalem, Antioch, Alexandria,</hi> &amp; <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> But if ſo, where then in the mean time was Rome? did ſhe not at all appeare in heaven? He tels us ſhe was comprehended under one. But which of them, or how it was, he ſheweth not, neither indeed could he. Beſides the old writers doe not agree, about the tipes of the beaſts, in applying them to the Evangeliſts. The common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, is that <hi>Matthew</hi> ſhould be the <hi>man:</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> the <hi>Lyon:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de conſenſu Evang. cap.</hi> 6.</note> but <hi>Austin</hi> &amp; <hi>Bede</hi> will have the contrarie. The reaſon alleadged why <hi>Matthew</hi> is likened to <hi>a man</hi> is, becauſe he begins his Goſpel from the generation of Chriſt according to his manhood: Againe <hi>Marc</hi> to a <hi>Lyon,</hi> in regard he begins from the preaching of the Baptiſt, crying like a Lyon in the wilderneſſe: ſo <hi>Luke</hi> to an <hi>Oxe,</hi> beginning his Goſpel with the ſacrifice of <hi>Zacharie. Iohn</hi> is the <hi>flying Eagle,</hi> in writing high and great myſteries of Chriſts divinity. But what ſoliditie there is in theſe things, let others judge.</p>
                     <p>It is tedious to ſet downe their reaſons, why theſe beaſts ſhould appeare in foure diverſe formes. Firſt as a <hi>Lyon,</hi> becauſe (ſay they) God under the Law of nature ſhewed his glorie immediately unto the fathers. <hi>Secondly,</hi> as an <hi>Oxe,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord then required ſuch beaſts to be offered in ſacrifice. <hi>Thirdlie,</hi> as a <hi>man,</hi> becauſe the ſon of God was made man. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> as an <hi>Eagle,</hi> becauſe the holy Ghoſt deſcending from heaven, cauſeth the righteous to fly upward.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ribera</hi> maintaining the common opinion,

That the common expoſition obſerves the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of writing: But <hi>Iohn</hi> the things, according to their manifeſtation: for the Baptiſt began to preach before Chriſt. But this is to abuſe the reader: beſides how could <hi>Iohn</hi> ſee the foure Evaugeliſts in the heavens, he beeing himſelf one of them here then preſent upon earth? To this <hi>Ribera</hi> anſwers. That <hi>John</hi> ſaw thoſe things which long after his death were to come to paſſe. But this ſeems to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the text: foraſmuch as he ſaw the <hi>foure beaſts,</hi> which were then in heaven, as alſo <hi>the foure and twenty Elders,</hi> that is, the Church triumphant with Chriſt. Some interpret this of the foure <hi>Monarchies,</hi> with the diverſe conditions of the Church
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:96676:71"/>militant under them, and for this cauſe they are ſaid to have ſeverall formes, or faces: but the following thankſgiving little ſutes with worldly monarchies.</p>
                     <p>Others referre it to the foure principall myſteries of faith:
<note place="margin">If the foure mysteries of faith.</note> The myſterie of Chriſts incarnation to the face of a man. His paſſion and death to the forme of an oxe, as bearing our iniquities, and becauſe he was ſacrificed for us. His reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to a Lyon, even the <hi>Lyon of the tribe of Iuda,</hi> overcoming death: And laſtly by his aſcenſion, he reſembles the flying Eagle.</p>
                     <p>To be ſhort,
<note place="margin">Whither foure prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels:</note> there are ſome who expound this place of foure principall Angels: alluding to the beaſts in <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> which ſhadowed out (as they ſay) ſo manie An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. But this cannot be: For 1: the Angels are manifeſtly diſtinguiſhed from theſe beaſts, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.11. Againe becauſe theſe together with the Elders ſing prayſes to the Lambe, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Thou hast rede med us to God by thy blood: and haſt made us to our God, kings &amp; prieſts.</hi> which argues they were men, and not Angels.</p>
                     <p>But not to uſe many words:
<note place="margin">They are the Church of the New Teſtament.</note> Even as the foure and twenty Elders typifie the Church of the Patriarchs and Prophets: ſo the foure beaſts ſhadow out the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall Church triumphing with Chriſt in heaven. So then the Elders are types of the legal, and the beaſts of the Evangelicall Church, both gloriouſly raigning with Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>But why doe theſe appeare before the throne? becauſe, as the thankſgiving and following viſions manifeſt, this is the ſecond apparition, and ſerves for a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold uſe in this heavenly ſight: not onely for the making up of the celeſtiall har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, but alſo to beare a ſpeciall part with the companie of Elders, thorow out the viſions.</p>
                     <p>The different forme of the foure beaſts,
<note place="margin">Why the formes of the beaſts are diverſe.</note> doth ſignifie the gathering of the Church of the New Teſtament, from the foure corners of the world, conſiſting of diverſe nations, and peoples, and tongues: wheras the <hi>foure and twenty Elders</hi> are uniforme: becauſe the Church under the Law conſiſted onely of the Iewiſh nation.</p>

                        <hi>And in the midſt of the Throne,
<note place="margin">After what manner they ſtood.</note> and round about the throne</hi>] There ſeems to be a difficulty in this, how they could ſtand in the midſt of the throne, and in the circuit of the throne. Some doe thinke, that they ſo ſtood, and held up the throne, like as the twelve oxen did underprop the <hi>brazen ſea</hi> in Solomons temple: which was ſo ſet upon them, that all their hinder parts were inward, 1 <hi>King</hi> 7.25. But that cannot bee, for then theſe beaſts ſhould have ſtood immoveable: wheras on the contrarie we read, that oftentimes they fell downe and worſhipped the Lambe: yea one of them Chap. 15.7. gave unto the ſeven Angels, ſeven vials full of the wrath of God, &amp;c.</p>

Thus by this heavenly forme, is ſet forth what they had been, and alſo how all other teacher ought ſtill to be quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied here on earth.</p>

                        <hi>And the first beast was like a Lyon</hi>] The ſhape likewiſe of every beaſt is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the viſion in <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> onely there, each living creature had <hi>foure faces:</hi> wheras here each of them hath but one. The diverſity of their formes denoteth the diverſity of gifts in teachers, as a <hi>Lyon</hi> their fortitude and courage: <hi>an Oxe</hi> their labour and patience: <hi>a Man</hi> their underſtanding and prudencie: And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Eagle</hi> their quickneſſe and ſharpeneſſe of ſight: Now for other myſteries from this place I thinke it not meet for men to ſeeke further. But if any one be prodigal of his time, and deſires to read more of theſe Elders and beaſts: he may if it be not too tedious unto him, read Alcaſar on this booke, from page 339. unto page 398.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And the foure beaſts</hi>] The firſt part of this verſe containes a deſcription of the beaſts: the latter a beginning of the thanksgiving. Now becauſe the fourth is compared unto an <hi>Eagle,</hi> he therfore attributes unto every one of them ſixe wings, <hi>full of eyes before and behinde:</hi> which is taken out of the viſion of <hi>Iſay,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6.2.</note> where the uſe of ſo many wings is recorded; for otherwiſe we ſe, that birds need not more then two, to fly withall. The <hi>Seraphims</hi> are ſaid to fly with two wings: with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two they cover their faces, as not beeing able to behold the majeſty of God: And with two they cover their feet: that nothing unbeſeeming the divine majeſty might appeare about them. In that their wings are <hi>full of eyes,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Why their wings are full of eyes.</note> it denotes that full and perfect light or knowledge, which the Church enjoyeth with God in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens. Thus we have heard the deſcription of the foure beaſts, and it is as I ſaid before, the ſecond apparition or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie ſinging prayſes to God, &amp; to the Lambe: as here, ſo alſo in <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.8. &amp; 7.11. &amp; 19.14. and as being miniſters to God, &amp; publiſhers of the following viſions. See <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 1.3.5.7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15.17. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And they rest not day and night</hi>] Now he ſhewes what was don both by the <hi>beaſts,</hi> and by the <hi>Elders:</hi> the <hi>beaſts</hi> inceſſantly worſhip God: The <hi>Elders</hi> ryſing from their ſeats fall downe, before him that ſits on the throne, and worſhip him: caſting their crownes before the Throne: ſinging prayſes together with the beaſts. This is the thankſgiving wherewith the Church triumphant doth for ever celebrate God in the heavens. The harmony, is the conſenting voyce of all the Prophets and Apoſtles. This is that excellent and moſt ſweet accord of all the ſaintes, with one mouth ſaying, <hi>Holy, holy, holy: Thou art worthy, O Lord, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive honour, and glory, and power.</hi> This is that which we are commanded to pray for: <hi>Thy will be don in earth as it is in heaven.</hi> The which we are bound not onely to deſire, but alſo after the examples of the ſaintes in heaven, without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to celebrate the praiſes of the Lord, while we are here on earth, both in thoughts, words and actions. And this is the ſum.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Holy, holy, holy</hi>] Thus alſo the <hi>Seraphims</hi> cryed one to another <hi>Iſay.</hi> 6.3. by which threefold acclamation, is ſignifyed eyther the holie Trinity, or els a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall iteration of thankſgiving: for God is thrice holy, moſt holy, yea holineſſe and puritie it ſelf, the ſanctifyer of men and Angels.</p>

<note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about the booke.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moſt interpret it either of the booke of the old Teſtament, or els the whole volume of Gods booke both old and new: which is in the <hi>right hand of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:96676:73"/>God:</hi> becauſe it is inſpired by the holy Ghoſt, and the contents thereof are in the hands of God alone. This booke is <hi>written within,</hi> that is obſcurely in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, <hi>&amp; without,</hi> that is openly in the new: or <hi>within</hi> as reſpecting the myſtical ſence, <hi>without</hi> the litterall. It is <hi>ſealed with ſeven ſeales,</hi> becauſe the myſteries there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are hid from humane reaſon.
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14.</note> 
                        <hi>It cannot be opened</hi> by any creature, becauſe <hi>the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man receiveth not the things which are of God.</hi> The Lambe alone is worthy to open it: becauſe he onely hath fulfilled the ſcriptures: and he onely doth reveal unto us, outwarly by his word, and inwardly by his ſpirit, the hid things thereof.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things in themſelves are true, and according to godlines, but I judge they ſerve little to the purpoſe in hand: becauſe here he treats not about the obſcurity, or manifeſtation of legal types: neyther are the myſteries thereof revealed in this booke: but things of another nature, and which concerne the condition of the Church under the Goſpel. Neither can it be ſaid that the old and new Teſtament was as a ſealed booke unto all creatures untill the time of Iohn: ſeeing it would then follow that both the Prophets, and Apoſtles were ignorant of the writings of Moſes and the Prophets. Beſides all the bookes of the new Teſtament were then already written: and ſo not ſhut, but knowen unto all ſuch as had their ſences exerciſed in the ſcriptures of God: even as the preaching of the Apoſtles opened a doore unto the faith of the Goſpell unto every creature: And therefore this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation ſeems to be repugnant to the holy ſcriptures, and injurious to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall Churches.</p>
                     <p>They ſeem to come neerer the marke,
<note place="margin">Another opinion of the booke.</note> who underſtand it of the booke of Gods providence. For the ſcriptures attribute three ſorts of bookes to God, 1. Of his providence, 2. of life, and 3. of univerſall judgement: of which we have treated Chap. 3.5. But theſe alſo differ in opinion. Some take it in a generall way for the booke of <hi>Gods decree</hi> concerning the governement of the world: which interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is to large, ſeeing not all Gods ſecret judgements, but onely ſuch, which concerne the ſtate of the Church are here intended.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I rather aſſent to them,
<note place="margin">The booke is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation it ſelf.</note> who underſtand it litterally, of the booke, in which all theſe things were contained, which Chriſt was pleaſed to reveale unto <hi>Iohn</hi> concerning the laſt times, the which he afterward penned, and left the ſame unto the Churches. This booke, I ſay, is the <hi>revelation</hi> it ſelf: not as if he ſaw a materiall booke, but <hi>a viſionall booke</hi> (ſo to ſpeak) wherin was written Gods ſecret decree touching the future event of the Church, and her enemies. Thus alſo <hi>Andreas,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ribera</hi> expound it.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>firſt</hi> this is the ſame booke, which <hi>Iohn</hi> (after it was opened) is commanded <hi>to eat up,</hi> that is, fully and clearly to take knowledge thereof: And <hi>which was ſweet in his mouth like hony,</hi> that is, he was much delighted with the knowledge of ſo high myſteries: but by and by it became <hi>bitter in his belly as gall,</hi> that is, he was much greeved in foreſeeing the great calamities of the Church, as we ſhall ſee <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. for the booke there mentioned is the <hi>Revelation</hi> given unto Iohn.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore the contents of the whole Revelation is taken out of this booke. For at the opening of the <hi>ſeventh ſeale,</hi> ſeven Angels are ſaid to come forth ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with trumpets, ſignifying thereby the diverſe changes of the Church, in the <hi>third viſion.</hi> At the ſounding of the ſeventh trumpet, the <hi>Dragon,</hi> and <hi>two beaſts</hi> are raiſed up againſt the Church, <hi>in viſion the fourth.</hi> Preſently here upon follow <hi>ſeven Angels</hi> powring forth the vials of the laſt plagues upon the earth, <hi>in viſion the fift.</hi> Afterward one of theſe ſeven Angels pronounceth with a mighty voyce <hi>the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the great whore,</hi> and ruin of Babylon, <hi>in viſion the ſixt.</hi> At length the <hi>new Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> with the marriage of the Lamb is repreſented unto <hi>John, in the laſt viſion.</hi> whence we ſee that the whole matter of the Revelation was comprehended in <hi>this booke:</hi> &amp; not included in a few Chapters: viz. from 6. to 11. as <hi>Alcaſar</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth.</p>
                     <p>To be ſhort the circumſtances of this booke doe altogether agree with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer preface. For as Chriſt is there ſaid to receive the Revelation of God, and by
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:96676:73"/>an Angel to deliver it unto <hi>Iohn:</hi> ſo this booke was in the right hand of him that ſate on the throne, &amp; taken out of his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by the Lamb, opened, &amp; delivered unto the Angel, who gave it to Iohn, commanding him to <hi>eat it, Chap.</hi> 10. Foraſmuch therefore as all things thus agree together, there is no queſtion, but this booke here ſpoken of, is the revelation it ſelf, delivered unto the Apoſtle. Theſe things obſerved, the three following circumſtances will bee the leſſe obſcure.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The booke is held in the <hi>right hand of him that ſits on the throne</hi>] becauſe God is the author of the revelation: in Gr. it is, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>at the right hand,</hi> and is put for, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>in the hand,</hi> as appeares v. 7. where the <hi>Lambe</hi> takes the booke (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) <hi>out of his right hand,</hi> &amp; therefore it was <hi>In</hi> and not <hi>at</hi> his right hand, as ſome will have it. Now he is ſaid to have it in <hi>his right hand,</hi> to the end to give it unto Chriſt to open. As men reach out with their right hands, what they give unto others: And I ſuppoſe we need not ſeek for any other myſterie in this expreſſion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is <hi>written within and without</hi>] that is, there was no place emptie in it. For we are to underſtand this litterally. This <hi>booke</hi> was not made as are our bookes, conſiſting of diverſe leaves, and ſo folded together: but it was one volume of parchment written within and without: according to the cuſtome of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, who wrote in rolles: and hence <hi>volumen,</hi> a volume, comes from <hi>convolvendo,</hi> rolling. Like as the Iewes to this day at <hi>Wormes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Franck ford,</hi> &amp;c. have their <hi>(Torah)</hi> written out in one volume of parchment. Theſe parchments, becauſe they were rolled up, were commonly writ on the inſide onely. Wheras this on the contrarie, was written within, &amp; on the backſide alſo: which manner of rols were called, (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,) that is, <hi>writings, within and without,</hi> of which ſee <hi>Plinie.</hi> lib. 3. Epiſt. 5. and <hi>Iuvenal</hi> Sat. 2.</p>
                     <p>I therefore judge, that this <hi>writing, within and without</hi> ſignifies nothing els, but the multitude of matters: that is all ſuch things as were exhibited unto <hi>John</hi> in this Revelation. <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith that <hi>within</hi> were written the promiſes made to the Church, and <hi>without,</hi> or on the backſide, the puniſhments of the wicked. But this to me ſeems frivolous. A like booke written within and without was ſeen by <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiel</hi> Chap. 2.9. but it differs from the other both in matter and forme. In that were written the lamentations becauſe of the calamities to befal the people of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael in their captivity: wheras this <hi>booke</hi> containes the ſecret counſels of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the laſt times. That of Ezechiel, was ſpread open before him: but this was ſeen of Iohn rolled up: Ierom underſtandeth that by both theſe bookes which were written within and without, is ſignified the <hi>litterall</hi> &amp; <hi>myſticall</hi> ſence of the ſcriptures. But there is no ſolidity in it: for neyther of theſe bookes, doe ſignify the booke of holy writ: neither doth every part of the ſcriptures, admit a myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call interpretation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sealed with ſeven ſeales</hi>] This is the third circumſtance touching the booke. The number <hi>ſeven,</hi> is not here put for many, but is to be taken properly: for after theſe, there were no more ſeales opened. We need not ſearch what manner of <hi>ſeales</hi> they were, it ſufficeth to know that the booke was cloſely kept ſhut by them. For there is a twofold uſe of <hi>ſeales,</hi> firſt to keep things ſecret from the vew of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as letters, doores, cabinets, chieſts, and the like: and ſecondlie for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of writings, as for example, to authoriſe the edicts of princes, ſentences of magiſtrates, and wills of the dead, the ſeales of ſeven witneſſes make theſe things altogether authentick. Now this booke, was not ſealed in this latter reſpect, but in the former, as beeing ſhut or kept cloſe from the underſtanding of men. And therefore it could not be opened or read before the ſeales were taken away: which was not don until the ſeventh ſeale was removed. Let this ſuffice for the preſent, that the contents of this booke ſo faſt ſealed, were moſt obſcure &amp; hid, untill (the ſeales beeing opened) they were revealed unto Iohn by Chriſt.</p>

He ſaw it made faſt with many ſeales: he heard the Angel proclaiming the opening thereof. Whence he concludes that therin was contained many worthy things neceſſarie to be known: but ſeeing all creatures were ſilent, as unable to open it, he weeps much, and good cauſe too. Now his weeping was not in vaine: for by his prayers &amp; teares he hath his deſire granted him to the ful. And here we are taught, that the myſteries contained in Gods word, whither in this or other places, are not to be underſtood without weeping: that is, deſire ſtudy, labour and ardent prayers unto God.

                        <hi>Stood as it had been ſlaine</hi>] The geſture of the Lamb is twofold. He ſtood, and as it were ſlain. By the latter his death is ſignified, by the former his reſurrection.

Wherefore he ſtood as a conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, revived from death to life, having like a Lion overcome the ſame.

                     <p>Let us alſo brieflie take notice, how Antichriſt <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.11. hath <hi>two hornes like unto the Lamb,</hi> ſignifying that he like an Ape imitates the Lamb.

                        <hi>He came</hi>] That is, he came forth out of the midſt, &amp; went to the throne, and tooke the booke out of the right hand of him that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>te thereon, viz. to open the ſame. By which action he ſheweth, that he both can and will unſeale the booke of God, that is, reveale this propheſie unto Iohn, and unto the whole Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in heaven. Thus we have here fulfilled: what is ſpoken <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.1. to wit, that God gave the Revelation to Chriſt, &amp; Chriſt to Iohn. For this <hi>Lamb,</hi> that is, Chriſt tooke the <hi>Revelation</hi> out of the right hand of God on the throne, not unwillingly, but freely giving it him, to the end it might be revealed unto Iohn, and unto the whole Church: I will not be curious in diſputing what this taking of the booke was. They who underſtand by this <hi>booke,</hi> the whole counſel of God, interpret this taking thereof, a commiſſion to reveal the ſecret myſteries of ſalvation unto the Church. But we have ſhewed <hi>v.</hi> 1. that the booke denotes the <hi>Revelation.</hi> Wherfore this taking and opening of it, ſignifies nothing elſe, but the expoſition thereof.</p>
                     <p>But this ſeems to contradict the interpretation touching Chriſts ſitting on the Throne. For the Lamb ſits not on the throne, but takes it from him that ſate ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now he cannot be both giver and receiver. I anſwer. It is true he cannot give, and receive in one and the ſame reſpect: but there will follow no abſurdity to ſay he doth it in a diverſe reſpect: to wit if we conſider his perſon and office. Chriſt gives the booke as he is God, and takes it as he is <hi>God-man,</hi> the mediatour. Thus he is both author and opener of the booke: even as he is ſaid in diverſe reſpects <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. v. 9. &amp; 9. v. 11.14. &amp; 13.10. to be <hi>prieſt, ſacrifice, altar,</hi> the <hi>anointer</hi> &amp; <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed.</hi> But if any wil contend, that God abſolutely is he that ſits on the throne, it comes al to one thing, as I have formerly proved. For the Father ſits, and reignes in the ſon to whom he hath given all judgement.</p>

It is called a <hi>new ſong,</hi> that is, moſt ſingularly ſetting forth the great, rare, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent benefits of the Lambe. For generally in the Pſalmes a <hi>new ſong,</hi> is taken in
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:96676:76"/>this ſence. The former <hi>Hymne Chap.</hi> 4.8. was ſung unto him that ſate on the throne: but this is a ſong unto the Lamb. So <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.1. the ſaintes in heaven <hi>ſing a new ſong unto the Lamb,</hi> which none could learn, but theſe <hi>hundred fourty and four thouſand which had his fathers name written in their foreheads.</hi> The argument therefore of this ſong is <hi>new,</hi> becauſe it is moſt excellent, and containes the new benefits of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thou art worthy</hi>] They acknowledge him alone worthy to take the booke, and to open the ſeales, becauſe they both know and confeſſe with all reverence, that he is the onely mediatour of the Church, and that the cauſe of this his great worthineſſe is in the preciouſnes of his blood.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For thou wast ſlaine</hi>] that is, by dying for the ſins of the world, thou declareſt thy ſelf to be the Meſſias,

Here we are taught that the mediatour ought both to be ſlaine for us, that is, to merit: and alſo to take the booke, that is meritoriouſly to beſtow life and righteouſnes upon others. Seeing therefore he onely merited by his ſacrifice, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that none elſe could take the booke, that is, reveale the counſell of God to the Church, and by his power give ſalvation unto her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And thou hast redeemed us to God by thy blood</hi>] Now the Church triumphant prayſeth the Lambe, and applyeth the price of her redemption with the effects thereof unto her ſelf. Thus we ought ſo to acknowledge the benefits of Chriſt, as to make them our owne, not onelie in beleeving that he hath redeemed others by his blood, <hi>and made them kings and prieſts to God,</hi> but our ſelves alſo: for true juſtifying faith is accompanied with a certaine perſwaſion of our own ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>I live,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>by the faith of the ſon of God who loved me,
<note place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>Hence we obſerve two things: <hi>First,</hi> that the death of Chriſt is truly a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſatisfactorie for our ſins: and that our redemption by it, is not metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal (as the new <hi>Samoſatenians</hi> blaſphemouſlie affirme) but proper: for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption which is made by a price is proper. But ſuch is ours by Chriſt, becauſe by the ſhedding of his blood, he hath paid a full ranſome, and ſatisfied the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God, as the ſcripture witneſſeth <hi>Matt.</hi> 20.28. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. beeing the ſame with what is here ſaid, <hi>thou hast redeemed us by thy blood:</hi> and <hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondlie,</hi> that the redemption made by Chriſts blood, is truely univerſal, as ſufficient, and propounded not onely to one nation, or a few, but to all nations, tongues and peoples: yet not ſo, as if all promiſcuouſly ſhould be ſaved: but thoſe of everie tribe, people, and language, who beleeve in Chriſt. And thus much the Elders teach us: <hi>Thou haſt redeemed us out of every tribe.</hi>

                        </note> that this redemption proves the Lamb to be God omnipotent. For to redeem the Church from ſin, death and ſatan, is a worke of divine power, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.8.

                     <p n="10">10 <hi>And made us to God</hi>] They magnifie the Lambe, for three other benefits. 1. That he hath made us kings, 2. prieſts, 3. given us a kingdome on the earth. The two former we have expounded Chap. 1.6. beeing meant of our ſpiritual kingdome and prieſthood. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. &amp; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. But how ſhall we raigne on the earth, ſeeing Chriſts kingdome is not of this world: beſides earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things periſh in their uſe: and laſtly the Church in this life is to expect nothing but tribulation? <hi>Andreas</hi> ſaith, that the Church ſhall reigne, not in this preſent
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:96676:77"/>thick and cloudie world: but in that new one, which is promiſed unto the meek, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.5. But the ſaints may truly be ſaid to reigne here on earth diverſe wayes. <hi>First,</hi> by mortifying their earthly deſires, and trampling them under their feet. Secondly, as Chriſt raignes on the earth, not by a ſecular but ſpirituall power, by which he forceth the adverſarie unto obedience: Even ſo the faithfull doe raigne with Chriſt in the earth. For the head raigning, the members raigne alſo: to be ſhort, the ſaintes with Chriſt ſhall judge the world, and therefore ſhall rule the ſame: however we are to underſtand this, not of an earthlie, but a ſpirituall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion:

                     <p n="11">11. <hi>And I beheld, and round about the throne</hi>] The third apparition is of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels who ſing <hi>the new ſong</hi> together with the beaſts and Elders: for howſoever the Angels are not redeemed by the blood of Chriſt, as men: yet in Chriſt they are gathered together in one,

                           <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.10.</note> beeing ſubject unto him as to the head of the Church, whereof they are members: and therefore they alſo prayſe the Lambe, as their Lord, and bleſſe him in regard of the redemption of man-kind. The number of Angels he ſaw, are ſaid to be <hi>ten thouſand times ten thouſand &amp; thouſands of thouſand,</hi> that is, infanite: for ſo the Hebrewes ſpeaking of time without end: expreſſe it, by <hi>ages of ages.</hi> This number ſeems to be taken out of <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.10. where many millions of Angels ſtood before the fiery throne of God: which is for the excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great comfort of the godly: for ſeeing ſo many thouſands of Angels are ready to doe the commandement of God, and of the Lambe: why then ſhould we feare any adverſary power which lifts it ſelf up againſt God and his Church.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Saying with a loud voyce worthy is the Lambe</hi>] This company of Angels with ſongs and prayſes, ſet forth ſeven divine titles of the Lambe, all which he is moſt worthy to receive: not as if he received them from the creatures, but becauſe all creatures are bound to render the ſame as moſt due unto him, ſeeing he hath obtained all theſe things by eternall generation, and by his exaltation at the right hand of God his Father. And it is worthy our obſervation, that however all theſe titles are moſt divine: yet the <hi>Vbiquitie</hi> of his fleſh is not reckoned amongſt them.</p>

                        <hi>Strength</hi>] Becauſe by his divine ſtrength and power, he hath overcome ſatan, the world and all other enemies.</p>

                        <hi>Glorie</hi>] becauſe he gloriouſly raigneth at the right hand of his father.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bleſſing</hi>] he is worthy indeed to be bleſſed for ever: becauſe in and through him, all nations are made partakers of all bleſſings.</p>
                     <p n="13">13 <hi>And every creature</hi>] The fourth apparition is of all reaſonable creatures in heaven and in earth: and of unreaſonable both in the ſea, and under the earth. <hi>And all that are in them</hi> viz. whither in heaven, or in the earth, or in the ſea. <hi>Ribera</hi> underſtands by the creatures under the earth, the ſoules in purgatorie: But this fiction <hi>Alcaſar</hi> approves not of. Others underſtand it of the evill ſpirits which will they nil they are compelled to acknowledge, &amp; to ſtand in fear of the power &amp; glorie of Chriſt: not becauſe they love him, but hate him and murmure againſt him. But the true meaning is, that not onely men, but all creatures, yea even the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels themſelves doe ſhew forth the prayſe of God,
<note place="margin">XXXI. <hi>Argum. of Chriſts deity.</hi>
                        </note> becauſe in ſome ſort, they ſerve to illuſtrate and ſet forth his glorie.</p>
                     <p>Here again we may note that Chriſt is adored with religious worſhip by all creatures, the which evidentlie proves that he is God: and this is to be added to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:96676:77"/>the former arguments. The exception of the <hi>Samoſatenians</hi> is frivolous, who will have a created divinity to be communicated unto Chriſt. But God himſelf ſaith, that <hi>he will not give his glory,</hi> that is, the glory of religious worſhip, <hi>to any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> But the Idolatrous Papiſts doe more ſhamefully diſhonour God and the Lamb in attributing religious worſhip to Angels, to the ſpirits of men deceaſed, to Images &amp;c: let them therfore looke to it, how they wil anſwer the foreſaid he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, nay rather how they will anſwere the Lord, when he ſhall call them to account for it.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. <hi>And the foure beaſts</hi>] As the beaſts and Elders were firſt in manifeſting their joy: ſo here againe they joyne with the Angels and other creatures in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Lamb &amp; conclude the thanksgiving by ſaying <hi>Amen</hi> thereunto: of which ſee Chap. 1.6.

If out of the booke, then this horſeman went forth at the very firſt opening of the margent, that is, the myſterie of him was there both written and revealed to Iohn: giving us to underſtand, that ſuch was the forme of the ſeales, and ſo ſet on the margent, as they ſerved for the keeping cloſe of the whole booke folded up together, according to our manner of ſealing letters.</p>
                        <p>If he went out of the ſeale, then it ſeemes theſe were annexed to the booke, like the great ſeales of princes to their letters pattents, the which are uſually kept in boxes. Now one ſeale beeing removed, ſome part of the booke was thereby opened, in ſo much as the writing thereof did appeare. Behold a great ſeale, out of which went forth an armed horſeman: But how great then was the booke it ſelf, ſealed with ſo many ſeales? how great was he that held ſo great a booke in his right hand? yea, how great the Lamb opening it? The which may lead us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the greatnes of the events, and the omnipotencie of God, and the Lamb.

                        <p>Now to ſpeak of the opening of the ſeales in general, <hi>Andreas</hi> doth juſtlie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject their expoſition: who referr all of them to the manner of Chriſts incarnation: as the <hi>firſt ſeale</hi> to his birth: The <hi>ſecond</hi> to his baptiſme: The <hi>third</hi> to the ſignes he wrought after his baptiſme? The <hi>fourth</hi> to his unjuſt accuſation before Pilate: The <hi>fift</hi> to his croſſe: The <hi>ſixt</hi> to his burial: And the <hi>ſeventh</hi> to his deſcenſion into hel: <hi>ſeeing,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>all this was alreadie don, whereas Iohn ſpeaks eyther of things preſent, or what ſhould come to paſſe afterward.</hi>

                        <p>Others more wittilie have diſtinguiſhed theſe ſeales according to the future times of the Church: applying the <hi>firſt</hi> to the Apoſtles time, and 200 yeares after. The <hi>ſecond</hi> unto the following age: <hi>viz.</hi> the time of <hi>Juſtinian.</hi> The <hi>third</hi> unto <hi>Phocas</hi> the uſurper of the Empire. The <hi>fourth</hi> unto Charles the Great, when po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie was at the higheſt: The <hi>fift</hi> unto <hi>Ottho</hi> under whom the ſeven Electors were erected: The <hi>ſixt</hi> to the counſel of <hi>Conſtans,</hi> at what time the Church was grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly perſecuted by three Anti-popes, and the burning of the TWO WIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESSES, whereupon the elect were ſealed. The <hi>ſeventh</hi> from that time unto the end of the world: during al which time in the diverſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſions of the Church, the ſealing of the faithfull was perfected.

                        <p>
                           <hi>And behold, a white horſe</hi>] I ſee no reaſon,
<note place="margin">The white horſe ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doweth out the puritie of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church.</note> but the common opinion of interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters is heere to be embraced viz. that this <hi>white horſe</hi> with his rider, notes the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty &amp; integrity of the Chriſtian Church at firſt (for by whitenes in the revelation, purity is ſignified) and the ſpeedie courſe of the Goſpell throughout the whole earth. Nevertheleſſe I binde not this to the firſt two hundred or three hundred years, in which, (notwithſtanding all the cruel oppreſſion &amp; perſecutions yet) the Goſpell was ſpread with happie ſucceſſe far and neere. But I rather extend it to the whole time, in which Chriſt by the ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles, namelie many
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:96676:79"/>ſyncere Biſhops and faithfull teachers victoriouſly ſet up his kingdome, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Romane Empire, not withſtanding the tyrannie of perſecutors, &amp; the wickedneſſe of hereticks and Apoſtates: untill by little and little the Church decayed in this her puritie: And this I take containes the ſpace of almoſt ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>white horſe</hi> therefore firſt comming out of the ſeales, is the primitive Church, white, and bright in puritie of doctrine and diſcipline. The Apoſtles were like horſes running ſtrongly, and with great ſpeed, propagating the faith of Chriſt in the whole earth, as their Acts, and Epiſtles teſtifie: after them God raiſed up Apoſtolicall men, Biſhops, teachers, and Fathers both Greek &amp; Latine, who firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie maintained &amp; propagated the purity of doctrine delivered unto them, againſt tyrants, apoſtates and hypocrites, untill the time of <hi>Gregorie the first:</hi> although even before his dayes the whiteneſſe of this horſe was ſomwhat changed, &amp; black ſpots began to appeare, that is, corruptions in doctrine, diſcipline and worſhip.

Now he went forth to overcome the world, and the tyrants thereof diverſe wayes. His <hi>ſecond</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie was in converting the gentiles by the preaching of the Apoſtles: for in that he drew all nations, and brought them unto the faith of the Goſpel, he conquered the world; And tyrants, in his Apoſtles, confeſſours, &amp; martyrs, convincing them by the power of the truth: For the death of the martyrs is Chriſts victory: ſeeing in their blood the truth was ſealed, and the Church propagated. The deſtruction of tyrants was Chriſts victorie: As <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>apoſtate</hi> blaſpheming in his extreme madneſſe, confeſſed: <hi>Thou hast overcome O Galilean.</hi> Chriſt overcame, when <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro, Domitian, Diocletian, Trajan, Maximinus, Lycinius, Valens,</hi> and others (who had put to death many thouſands of Chriſtians, thinking thereby to take away the name of Chriſt) were deſtroyed, and brought to miſerable perdition, while Chriſt raigned; and his Church increaſed. Chriſt went forth as a conquerour, when by the preaching of the Goſpel, the Idol gods of the gentiles were rejected, their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and temples aboliſhed and overthrowen: all men beeing drawen after Chriſt.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:96676:79"/>He overcame when the ſwarmes of hereticks, as, <hi>Valentinus, Baſilides, Praxeas, Manes, Martion, Photinus, Samoſatenus</hi> and other moſt bitter enemies of Chriſt, were beaten downe, overcome and deſtroyed by the ſword of the ſpirit. To be ſhort, Chriſt overcame, when all the Eaſt and Weſterne Churches were in danger to periſh and come to nothing, by the peſtilent doctrine of <hi>Arius:</hi> two ſound miniſters beeing then hardlie found in the whole Chriſtian world, (no not in <hi>Rome</hi>) except <hi>Paulinus, Hilarius,</hi> and <hi>Athanaſius.</hi> And indeed he that would underſtand the victories of Chriſt here intimated, muſt have (as in a table before his eyes,) the hiſtories of the Apoſtles, and the Churches after them, written by <hi>Irenaeus, Clemens, Tertullian, Euſebius, Hierom, Theodoret, Socrates, Sozomenus, Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grius, Nicephorus,</hi> and others: for no better commentarie then their hiſtories can be given upon the opening of the <hi>first ſeale.</hi> And herein I thinke (not to paſſe this by in ſilence) we are more happie then Iohn himſelf: for thoſe events which he ſaw a far of in types, we now by the helpe of former hiſtories, and our own experience, doe clearely ſee them written out, &amp; livelie expreſſed before our eyes. And thus much concerning the firſt ſeale.</p>
                        <p>Now here perhaps a queſtion will be moved, ſeeing Chriſt is the Lamb ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the booke, how alſo he can be ſayd to goe forth out of the ſeale: For the anſwere hereof, we are to minde, what I have already ſpoken, viz. that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one and the ſame thing is repreſented in differing types, in a diverſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. Now as Chriſt ſits &amp; reignes gloriouſly with the Father and holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as God: ſo he is the Lion of the tribe of Iudah, beeing the offpring of Iudah according to the fleſh: He is the immaculate Lamb, as he is man, and as he was ſlaine and put to death for us: He ſtands in the midſt of the Throne, as he is the mediatour: he opens the booke and the ſeales, as he is the chiefe Prophet and teacher of the Church, the revealer and author of all heavenlie doctrine. And to be ſhort he alſo ſits on the <hi>white horſe,</hi> as king and conquerour, propagating his kingdome by the preaching of his word through the whole earth: by which alſo he reigneth even unto this day, in the midſt of his enemies.

Theſe beſides other foule errous, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly oppugned the myſterie of the bleſſed trinitie, denying Chriſt to be God and man, and the onely mediatour and ſaviour: who, although they profeſſed themſelves to be Chriſtians, and boaſted of the title of the Church, yet as much as in them lay, overthrew all Chriſtianity, and thus by the meanes of theſe men the <hi>white horſe</hi> was made <hi>black.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Againe in the two following ages, diverſe hereticks, as <hi>Photinus, Arius, Euno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius, Macedonins</hi> and others did exceedingly darken the doctrine of Chriſtian religion, and with their vile errours corrupted manie, who otherwiſe were godly teachers. <hi>Papias</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> were <hi>Chiliaſts</hi> or <hi>Millenaries, Tertullian</hi> a <hi>Montanist,</hi> (though theſe three lived in the former ages) <hi>Origine</hi> maintained manie errours.

For the truth is, moſt of them drew their hereſies out of adulterat, and apocrypha bookes, corrupting ſome places of holie writ for a cloake unto the ſame, but rejecting ſuch canonical bookes, as refuted their hereſies. And thus we ſee, how in this reſpect, Chriſt rides on hereticks. But <hi>ſecondlie,</hi> he doth it alſo by his providence, becauſe even in the greateſt confuſion of hereſies he was not wanting unto his Church.

Notwithſtanding I take it, that here not a cheapneſſe, but a dearth rather of food is foretold, ſeeing the meaſure of a dayes allowance, could hardly be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a dayes wages: which muſt needs cauſe ſcarſity both to man and beaſt.</p>
                        <p>But wherefore doth he propheſie of a famine, under the <hi>black horſe,</hi> the ſame ſhadowing out (as we have ſhewed) the corrupt ſtate of the Church under haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks? If we take it according to the letter, it ſeems not to cohere: For what need was there to foretell a dearth, which we know comes ordinarily to paſſe.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore the propheſie ſeemes myſtically to be underſtood,
<note place="margin">He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimes a myſticall famine.</note> not a famine of bread, but of the word of God, threatned here to be ſent upon the deſpiſers therof, according to that in the prophet: they <hi>ſhall wander from ſea to ſea, &amp; from the North even to the Eaſt: and run to and fro to ſeek the word of the Lord, but ſhould not finde it.</hi> Amos 8.11.12. Therefore in theſe words viz. by ſcarſitie of <hi>wheat</hi> &amp; <hi>barly,</hi> the Church is threatned with a ſpirituall famine: that is the Goſpel of Chriſt ſhould be ſo corrupted through the ambition, Luxurie, coveteouſnes, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence &amp; ſlothfulnes of Biſhops: &amp; the antie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t faith ſo adulterated by hereticks, as that nothing almoſt ſhould remaine pure &amp; ſound. We know by <hi>wheat,</hi> the elect are ſignifyed, and by <hi>tares,</hi> the reprobate, as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.30. Wherfore by <hi>wheat</hi> in this place, I underſtand either ſincere teachers which ſhould be rare &amp; precious: or els the ſound and orthodoxe doctrine concerning God &amp; Chriſt our ſaviour, of which there ſhould be, as it were, a famine in the earth. Nevertheleſſe with this <hi>wheat</hi> God would feed his elect, however it ſhould be obtained by great difficulty &amp; labour: yea <hi>barly bread</hi> ſhould be very ſcarſe, that is, the comforts of the Goſpel not ſo fullie enjoyed, as formerly.

                        <p>But theſe interpretations cannot ſtand: for undoubtedly the three foreſaid perſecutions were ſet forth under the <hi>red horſe:</hi> beſides it is not likelie that <hi>John</hi> ſaw the bloody face of the Church after her <hi>blackneſſe,</hi> but in order of time it went before.

                        <p>A certaine nameleſſe interpreter (whom manie follow) underſtands by the <hi>pale horſe,</hi> hypocrites and falſe brethren, who <hi>disfigure their faces that they may appeare unto men to faſt.</hi> Matt. 6.16.

For indeed I verely beleeve, beſides the bloody perſecutions of tyrants, &amp; black blaſphemies of hereticks, there is here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother evill of the Church ſhadowed out.</p>
                        <p>Therefore this <hi>pale horſe</hi> in kinde is the ſame with the three former, but of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther colour: for howbeit it ſignifies the ſame Chriſtian Church, yet is far otherwiſe to looke on then before, as having now her <hi>white, red</hi> &amp; <hi>black</hi> eſtate turned into a mortal <hi>paleneſſe,</hi> &amp; beeing ſick even unto death thorow the riſing of Antichriſt: ſhe was whole and ſound in the <hi>white horſe:</hi> covered with the blood of martyrs in the <hi>red horſe:</hi> ſpread over with hereſies in the <hi>black:</hi> But now ſo infirme, weak &amp; ſicklie, as that ſhe hath death on her back, and is neere to death and hell: For a fourth part periſheth with the <hi>ſword, famine, death,</hi> (or <hi>peſtilence</hi>) <hi>and beaſts of the earth:</hi> And theſe are the foure ſore plagues wherewith the Lord threatned to puniſh Ieruſalem for her apoſtacie. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 14.21.

                        <p>But whence came this deadlie diſeaſe, and <hi>paleneſſe</hi> unto the Church?
<note place="margin">When and how this paleneſſe befel the Church.</note> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, it was by accident occaſioned by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> that good Emperour, his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive bounty to Chriſtian Biſhops, by which indeed he inriched, but no way bettered the Church. For as to much indulgence of parents ſpoiles the childe: ſo this liberall Emperour was a meanes to draw Biſhops to pride, luxurie, idleneſſe, ſecurity &amp; other vices. For after he firſt had reſtored peace unto the Church, and heaped up honour &amp; wealth upon Biſhops (but ſpecially inlarged the juriſdiction of Rome) preſently followed ſuch a declining &amp; corruption in doctrine &amp; diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, as infected the Church with a deadly poiſon, brought upon her (I ſay) a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſickneſſe, in ſo much as the peſt of Antichriſt began now to enter into her very heart and bowels. And hence it is reported that a voyce from heaven was heard, ſaying; <hi>To day venome is powred foorth into the Church.</hi>

                        <p>The <hi>remote cauſe</hi> of this ſo great an evill conſidered in it ſelfe, was the guile, &amp; malice of that old ſerpent the devill, who laboured to ſupplant the Church through the eaſe and pompe of Biſhops, beeing otherwiſe not able to overthrow it by the ſword of tyrants: but the <hi>neerest cauſe</hi> was the hypocriſie of ſuperſtitious monks, with the pomp, luxury &amp; avarice of ambitious prelates, hereby making way for Antichriſts oppreſſion of the Church and truth.

Hereupon a great multitude of <hi>Moncks,</hi> (as a ſinke of miſchiefe,) overſpread the Church, by whom the truth of Chriſt (under the pretence of holines) was ſoon oppreſſed.

It is not improbable that here ſhould beginne <hi>a new Act,</hi> ſeeing <hi>Iohn</hi> is not now bidden by any one (as before he was) to behold the wonder of this <hi>fift ſeale.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In it three things are recorded, <hi>firſt,</hi> what he ſaw at the opening of the <hi>ſeale,</hi> &amp; the place where: namelie, <hi>the ſoules of the martyrs under the altar, v.</hi> 9. <hi>ſecondlie</hi> what they ſaid, <hi>v.</hi> 10. and <hi>laſtlie,</hi> the anſwere which they received. <hi>v.</hi> 11. The ſumme of al is, to comfort the Church againſt the ſcandal of the croſſe, ſpecially ſhadowed out under the <hi>red horſe.</hi> For leaſt Iohn ſhould have been to much daunted at the effuſion of the martyrs blood, or any of the faithfull ſo offended thereat as might have weakened their faith and pietie, but rather in hope of a more happie ſtate, with a Chriſtian courage might indure the furie and force of their adverſaries: therefore the bleſſed condition of the martyrs in heaven is here exhibited, beeing
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:96676:84"/>full of many comforts to the godlie, for they who in this world had been before cruellie murdered for the ſake of Chriſt, are now ſeen of <hi>Iohn</hi> under the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Chriſt, as glorious conquerours clothed with white robes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The ſoules under the altar]</hi> The ſoules departed out of the bodies are inviſible to the bodilie eye: but <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw them in the ſpirit: By which we learn, that the ſoule is ſeparable, ſubſiſting in it ſelf, immortal and dies not with the bodie. Of which matter <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> albeit an heathen, yet thus writeth, <hi>and thus the ſoule is an eſſential power, ſeparable, pure, and free from paſſion:</hi> and againe, as <hi>it is ſeparable, ſo alſo immortal, and eternal.</hi> Nevertheleſſe ſome have been found not onelie Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures, but even teachers in Iſrael (as the Saduces by name) who have denied it. Now theſe brutiſh men Chriſt plainelie refuteth in the Goſpel:

                           <hi>The ſoules of them that were ſlaine]</hi> that is, of the martyrs. But wherefore were they ſlaine? not for any evill committed, but <hi>for the word of God, and for the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie</hi> (viz.) of the Goſpel, that is, for their faith in Chriſt, which they openlie profeſſed and ſealed with their blood: here we ſee, that not ſuffering, but the cauſe of ſuffering makes a martyr. By <hi>the ſlaine,</hi> are meant not (as <hi>Alcaſar</hi> ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth) thoſe that were put to death by the Iewes: neither they onelie who ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red under <hi>Domitian</hi> untill <hi>Diocletian,</hi> as <hi>Lyra</hi> affirmeth: but the ſoules of all the martyrs, (even from <hi>Nero</hi> unto <hi>Boniface</hi> the third, the firſt Antichriſt) whoſe blood had been ſhed for the teſtimonie of Chriſt, beeing (as ſome call them) <hi>the twelve perſecutions.</hi>

Thus in <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.17. the dragon is ſaid to make war with them, <hi>which keep the commandements of God, &amp; have,</hi> that is, conſtantly maintaine, <hi>the teſtimonie of Christ.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But now where were the ſoules of the martyrs? not under the robe of <hi>Marie,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Where the ſoules of the martyrs were.</note> as painters fooliſhlie repreſent it: but <hi>under the altar,</hi> which was in heaven before the throne of God, as we ſhall ſee <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.3. <hi>Ribera</hi> here is to be hiſſed at, who affirmes that <hi>Iohn</hi> in this ſpeech hath reſpect to the ancient cuſtome of Chriſtians, laying up the relicks of ſaints under the altars. <hi>For when</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>an altar is buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, there is made under it a ſepulchre for to keep the relicks; and the priest, dipping his finger in the Chriſme makes the ſigne of the croſſe upon the foure corners of the ſepulchre, ſaying: This ſepulchre is conſecrated and ſanctified in the name of the Father, the Son, and the holie Spirit, peace be unto this houſe</hi> &amp;c. But this cuſtome is meerelie ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, and groſſe idolatrie, idlie invented manie ages after: For Iohn ſaw not any relicks of bones or garments, but <hi>the ſoules of martyrs,</hi> not in a ſepulchre, or under an altar of ſtone, but under the <hi>heavenlie altar,</hi> of which the Apoſtle ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Heb. 13.10. <hi>We have an altar whereof they have no right to eat, which ſerve the tabernacle.</hi> This <hi>altar</hi> is Chriſt (as <hi>Anſelmus</hi> and <hi>Haymo</hi> doe acknowledge,) under which he ſaw as in a type the ſoules of the martyrs, that is, under the ſafegard and protection of Chriſt. This beeing the firſt happineſſe which the martyrs enjoy in the heavens, is for the comfort and encouragement of them, who are yet to be ſlain. For however tyrants kill their bodies, yet their ſoules immediatelie upon their departing, are received of Chriſt: according to the prayer of Steven the firſt martyr, <hi>Lord Jeſus receive my ſpirit:</hi> and as Chriſt promiſed the thiefe: <hi>This day thou ſhalt bee with me in paradiſe.</hi> The which benefit <hi>Riberas gloſſe</hi> doth both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh, and wholie take away.</p>

Moreover here we are plainlie taught, that the ſoules of the martyrs, and other ſaintes departed, are not in the paines of <hi>purgatorie:</hi> but enjoy the preſence of Chriſt their ſaviour in the heavens. But touching this ſight of Chriſt, how, and after what manner they ſee God and Chriſt, I leave it to Sophiſters to diſpute of.

                           <hi>On them that dwell on the earth]</hi> A paraphraſe of tyrants, and their inſtruments: beeing unworthy to be named, onely approbriouſly they are called <hi>inhabitants of the earth,</hi> that is, earthlie and fooliſh men, preſuming to rebell againſt heaven to their owne deſtruction: cloſelie alſo implying their own preſent happy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as free from the furie of wordlings.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>How long?]</hi> They deſire the haſtening of Gods judgements. But here it may be demanded, how the ſoules of the ſaintes in heaven can be ſaid to be thus impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and deſirous of revenge? <hi>I anſwer</hi> their words import no impatient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, For the glorified ſaintes, are altogether free from all corruption this way: and therefore here is ſignifyed their earneſt deſire, that Gods glorie be vindicated, and the Church finally delivered from the tyrannie of implacable adverſaries: neyther doe they praeſcribe unto God any time touching his judgements, or the deliverance of the Church, but cloſelie ſubmit unto the ſame, as unknown to them when it ſhall be onely they intimate that to them it ſeems juſt &amp; equal, that he ſhould deliver his Church, and no longer ſuffer the blaſphemies and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of perſecutors. And therefore not deſiring to avenge themſelves, they commit vengeance unto the Lord: <hi>How long O Lord doeſt thou not avenge?</hi> not thriſting after it themſelves, but deſire that God in righteouſneſſe will admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the ſame, as knowing the juſt God will not ſuffer the crueltie of the wicked to be unavenged, and paſſe without puniſhment: yet they leave the manner and time to the Lords own diſpoſing: deſiring it no otherwiſe then as it may ſtand with his pleaſure and will. Thus we alſo here on earth pray to be <hi>delivered from that evill one,</hi> in which we contradict not the counſell of God, neither ſin againſt him, in praeſcribing the time and manner thereof: but ſhewing our deſire, wee attribute unto God the prayſe of his juſtice, faithfulnes and omnipotency, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that he both can &amp; at length will aſſuredly deliver us. Much leſſe therfore doe the ſoules of the ſaintes in praying for the ſame thing, ſin againſt the Lord. Vide <hi>Auguſt. ſerm.</hi> 11. <hi>de Sanstis.</hi>

But after the full deliverance of the ſaintes, that is, at the day of judgement, the other <hi>robe</hi> ſhalbe alſo given, that is, the ſaintes ſhalbe fully and perfectly glorified: This then is another comfort, namelie, that to the martyrs, in ſtead of the bloodie robe, with which tyrants here cloathed them, there ſhall be given them a <hi>white robe</hi> of joy and glorie in heaven.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And it was ſaid unto them]</hi> to wit, by him that ſate on the throne, or by the Lambe under whoſe ſhadow they reſted: neyther is it ſtrange, that Chriſt is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, as a <hi>Lamb,</hi> in regard of his death, and as an <hi>Altar,</hi> in regard of his <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Here are manie things touched in few words. Firſt it is a <hi>mild admonition,</hi> that the ſoules for the preſent ſhould be contented with their <hi>white robes,</hi> and ceaſe cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, expecting the time of Gods appointed judgement. It is alſo a <hi>cloſe commination</hi> of revenge after a litle ſeaſon: for however God for a while deferres puniſhment: yet he certainly heares the requeſt of the godlie, and at laſt will be fullie avenged on their adverſaries. It is alſo a <hi>propheſie</hi> of the future condition of the ſaintes under Antichriſt, by whoſe tyrannie manie martyrs are to brought to their end with fire and ſword. And laſtlie it is <hi>conſolation</hi> for the godlie under this anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian tyrannie: ſeeing their afflictions ſhall endure but for a moment, neyther ſhall Antichriſt rage according to his full deſire, but he ſhalbe be limited accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the decree and purpoſe of God, who hath determined the number of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, which number beeing once accompliſhed not one drop of blood ſhall more be ſpilt by him. And <hi>laſt of all,</hi> their fellow ſervants and bretheren which ſhould be killed, ſhall alſo be gathered under the ſame <hi>Altar,</hi> to pertake with them of the ſame bleſſednes.</p>
                        <p>Now Antichriſts time, is ſaid <hi>to be ſhort,</hi> or for <hi>a little ſeaſon,</hi> after the maner of the ſcripture, which ſpeaking of the laſt times compare them as it were, unto an houre in compariſon eyther of eternitie, or the age of the world alreadie paſt.</p>
                        <p>We are taught therefore in the <hi>firſt place,</hi> that God doth alwayes heare the prayers of his children: although touching their deliverance hee reſerve the time and manner thereof unto himſelfe, as beſt knowing when, and how to diſpoſe of all things for their good.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondlie,</hi> the blaſphemies &amp; outragious cruelties of the wicked, are never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of God: but vengeance certainlie is prepared for them, however he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beares them for a time.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the goodneſſe of God is the cauſe of this forbearance:
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4.</note> As to lead men unto repentance, ſo alſo that the full number of martyrs may be accompliſhed. And for this cauſe no doubt the Lord ſuffered the <hi>Romanes, Vandales, Gothes</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tyrants by the ſpace of ſix hundred years to ſhed much blood (though no
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:96676:86"/>more then was appointed) of the ſaintes for the confirmation of the Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: And no otherwiſe he decreed but from that time unto the end of the world, many ſhould ſuffer under Antichriſt for the ſame cauſet that ſo <hi>the judgement of the whore</hi> might be the more intollerable.</p>
                        <p>Hence we may not thinke, that either the Churches ſufferings under Antichriſt, were unknown unto the Lord, or happened againſt his will: but rather came to paſſe by his moſt wiſe counſell, in which we ought to reſt, &amp; never to be ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſed at his fury, nor rage of any of his inſtruments, but to reſt in the worke of God, if ſo be he have appointed eyther thee or mee to be among the number of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs. To <hi>be ſhort,</hi> here we ſee that there is a communion between the ſaints in heaven, &amp; thoſe on earth. For we are brethren &amp; fellow ſervants, neyther are they our lords,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22.9.</note> and patrones, as Idolaters imagine. And beeing fellow ſervants, they no leſſe refuſe divine worſhip, then did the <hi>Angel,</hi> who forbade <hi>Iohn</hi> to worſhip him, ſaying, <hi>See thou doe it not: for I am thy fellow ſervant, Worſhip God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But, ſay they, they pray for us: &amp; therfore we may pray to them. I anſwer, were this true, yet it would not follow. The reaſon is: becauſe there is a great difference betwixt praying for others, and to be prayed unto. To pray one for an other is a dutie of charity, and common unto all the faithfull. But to be religiouſlie invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated upon, is a worſhip due to God alone according unto the commandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God,

                                 <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.10</note> &amp; him onely ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> And the reaſon is, becauſe God alone is omniſcient, omnipote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; preſent in al places, hearing, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, &amp; onely able to fulfil the deſires of his people. But now the heavely An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, &amp; glorified ſpirits are neyther omniſcient, to behold all our actions: nor omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, as able to helpe us: nor can they be preſent with us in all places.</p>
                        <p>Beſides it is uncertaine,
<note place="margin">The inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of ſaintes is here not proved: but condemned.</note> yea falſe, that the ſaintes doe at al intercede for us: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any ſuch thing be proved from this place. For <hi>the ſoules</hi> of theſe martyrs pray not for their fellow ſervants, but to have their owne blood avenged; nay they knew not who they were, for elſe they would not have deſired a haſtening of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wrath: neyther at the inſtant was their requeſt granted, but deferred to the time appointed of God. To all which we may adde that from viſions, &amp; allegories no doctrines can or ought to be drawen, repugnant to the word of God: as this is concerning praying to the ſaintes:
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 26. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34</note> for it is derogatory unto the honour of Chriſt, who according to the ſcriptures, is our onely advocate in heaven: <hi>There is one me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour betwixt God &amp; Man, the Man Christ Jeſus:</hi> And, <hi>we have an advocate with the Father Ieſus Christ the Iust:</hi> And <hi>he maketh request for us.</hi> Now if the ſaintes were alſo our advocates: then ſhould not Chriſt be the <hi>onelie</hi> mediatour betwixt God &amp; Man. In deed we doubt not, but the ſoules of the ſaintes in a general way doe know the afflicted condition of the Church here, and deſire her deliverance: But in ſpeciall to know our affaires, they doe not, nor cannot.</p>

                        <p>Now this <hi>Act</hi> conſiſteth of two parts.
<note place="margin">The third Act of the ſecond vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion hath two parts.</note> The <hi>first</hi> treats of the greater &amp; more horrible confuſion of the Chriſtian world under Antichriſt: contained in the 12.13.14. following verſes, which are to be ſeparated from the laſt three verſes of the Chapt: the reaſon whereof I will ſhew by and by. The <hi>other part</hi> of the <hi>Act</hi> is more comfortable, as beeing oppoſed to the former troubles, in which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded unto the godlie for their great conſolation, the <hi>ſealing of the elect in their foreheads,</hi> in the firſt eight verſes of the following Chapter. Now unleſſe this be obſerved, howbeit manie things (I confeſſe) in a general way may be truely, learnedly &amp; piouſly treated of, touching this <hi>earthquake, darkening of the Sun,</hi> &amp; other <hi>prodigious</hi> things, as miſeries to befall the world: yet in deed theſe Generals tend, but to the darkening of the matter: And therfore for the right underſtanding of the <hi>ſixt ſeale,</hi> we muſt of neceſſity have recourſe to the hiſtories of the eaſt and weſterne kingdoms, both from the time that <hi>Popery</hi> was firſt eſtabliſhed in the Weſt, and <hi>Mahumetiſme</hi> in the Eaſt, as alſo diligently conſider the ſtate and experience of the preſent times: touching all which a word or two in Generall.</p>
                        <p>About the yeere of our Lord ſix hundred, after that the Church had obtained ſome reſt, &amp; was freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the perſecution of open enemies: ſhe immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be rent aſunder by diviſions, corrupted with diverſe hereſies, yea at length Pagan worſhip (under the cloake of Chriſtianitie) and humane traditions ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, as that ſhee became <hi>pale</hi> and ſick even unto the death: For then aroſe the hot contention between the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; <hi>Bizantium</hi> about the <hi>monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal primatie</hi> over all other Biſhops and Churches. Hereupon the Emperour <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritius</hi> much favouring <hi>Iovinian</hi> his metropolitan, made way for him to obtaine the <hi>primacie,</hi> under a pretence, that where the principall ſeat of the Empire was, there ought alſo to be the chiefe chaire of the Church: Now on the other hand <hi>Gregorie</hi> Biſhop of Rome, invying this honour of univerſalitie and power in his corrival,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 10. <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Epiſt</hi> 34.36.37.39.</note> affirmed that this title was <hi>wicked, perverſe, proud prophane, fooliſh and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous,</hi> neyther ought there to be any ſuch ſcandal raiſed among the Biſhops: at laſt he thus concludeth. <hi>I</hi> (ſaith he,) <hi>doe confidentlie affirm, that whoſoever either cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth himſelf, or deſireth to be called</hi> the univerſall prieſt, <hi>ſeeing herein out of the pride of his heart he lifts himſelf up above his fellow brethren, is the fore runner of</hi> Antichriſt. Thus we ſee that <hi>Gregorie</hi> makes the title of <hi>univerſall,</hi> to be the true badge of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt. And indeed he ſo much prevailed with the Emperour, as at that time the pride of <hi>Jovinian</hi> his corrival was repreſſed. But <hi>Mauritius</hi> a while after beeing wickedlie murdered by <hi>Phocas,</hi> and <hi>Gregorie</hi> dying about the yeere 604. Pope <hi>Sabinian</hi> his ſucceſſour (thirſting after the foreſaid tyrannie) burnt the writings of <hi>Gregorie,</hi> and made void his decrees: however he attained not what he aymed at, beeing preve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted the yeere after by an infamous death. After him ſucceeded <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> the third, who by <hi>Phocas</hi> the uſurper was proclaimed <hi>univerſal Biſhop, &amp; Prince of Prieſts,</hi> notwithſtanding the clergie &amp; moſt of the <hi>Italian Biſhops</hi> oppoſed the ſame. Thus he declared himſelf unto the whole world to be that <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and the firſt (as <hi>Platina</hi> and other writers affirme,) that eſtabliſhed his tyrannie by theſe inſolent expreſſions: as thus: <hi>we will and command: we appoint and charge, we will and require &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>From that time the Chriſtian world began to be ſhaken with a horrible mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For now Chriſt the <hi>Sun of righteouſnes</hi> was obſcured: The <hi>Moon of the Church</hi> turned into blood: The <hi>ſtarres</hi> fall from heaven, Biſhops become ſecular princes: <hi>heaven,</hi> or the opened booke of holy ſcriptures, rolled up: <hi>The mountaines,</hi> kings &amp; princes ſtand in jeopardy of their power: to be ſhort, the Iſlands are remooved out of there place, by beeing brought under the yoke of Romiſh tyrannie. <hi>Then,</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Balaeus</hi> hath diſtributed theſe Antichriſtian Popes from this <hi>Boniface</hi> unto <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> II: that is, from the yeere of Chriſt 606. unto the yeere 1513.
<note place="margin">Balae. in Act. Rom. Pont.</note> into five diſtinct claſſes or orders: as may there be ſeen. Who for the moſt part (as <hi>Genebrardus</hi> a Popiſh writer himſelf co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſeth) <hi>were Magicians, Sorcerers, Atheiſts, Adulterers, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, wicked, perjured, &amp; impure, not Apoſtolical, but apoſtatical and heretical men:</hi> they were (I ſay) capital enemies of Apoſtolical doctrine, inventours and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of idolatrie, ſuperſtition, and a new worſhip, bloodthirſtie men, and ſo have continued even unto this day. And here indeed the <hi>earthquake</hi> began to ſhake all Chriſtianity in the Weſterne parts.</p>
                        <p>Now about the ſame time, viz. in the yeere 609. <hi>Heraclius</hi> beeing Emperour (who toke away <hi>Phocas</hi> the tyrant) <hi>Mahumet</hi> an <hi>Iſmaelite</hi> by open force rayſed no leſſe an <hi>earthquake</hi> in the Eaſt. For he (beeing a ſouldiour and an hypocrite) by the help of the Perſians, tooke from <hi>Heraclius</hi> many provinces, and after he had eſtabliſhed a kingdom unto himſelf, he cauſed one <hi>Sergius</hi> a <hi>Nestorian Monke</hi> to compoſe the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> who mixed togerher ſomwhat of every religion, in ſuch a manner as might beſt ſerve to draw the affection of carnal people unto a love and liking thereof, thereby to ſtrengthen the politie of his new uſurped kingdom in the world, and the better to root out the faith of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>Whence it came to paſſe that by this <hi>commotion,</hi> moſt people in the Eaſt fell from Chriſtian religion, and the Sun of righteouſneſſe beeing darkened, the miſt of <hi>Mahumeticall ſuperſtition</hi> prevailed, and oppreſſed not the Eaſt alone, but all the ſouth parts of the world alſo: theſe are the <hi>earthquakes, darkening of the lights,</hi> and <hi>prodigious wonders</hi> here enigmatically deſcribed, according to the manner of propheticall ſcriptures. Now we come to the words themſelves.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And behold a great earthquake</hi>] moſt dreadfull and prodigious things, with which under the reigne of Antichriſt (as moſt interpreters both Greeke &amp; La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine confeſſe) the Chriſtian world, yea and heaven it ſelf too, were to be ſhaken: as the darkning of heavenlie lights, the falling downe of the ſtars, and laſtlie the the concuſſion of the mountaines and Iſlands are here ſhewed unto Iohn under the Image or form of a <hi>great earthquake.</hi> Indeed ſuch kind of praedictions are diverſe times mentioned both in the writings of the Prophets and Apoſtles: But not in one and the ſame ſence, the which thinge we are well to take notice of: for the circumſtance of the places, will lead us ſometimes unto a <hi>literall,</hi> &amp; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times unto an <hi>allegoricall</hi> interpretation thereof.</p>
                        <p>Vndoubtedly the predictions of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">The ſignes which are lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to be underſtood.</note> touching the end of the world and his laſt comming are to be taken litterallie: as in Matth. 24. Mar. 13. Luk. 11. <hi>Then there ſhall be ſignes in the Sun, and in the Moon, and in the Stars, and upon the earth diſtreſſe of nations, with perplexitie, the ſea, and the waves roaring, Mens hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after thoſe things which are comming on the earth; for the powers of heaven ſhall be ſhaken, and then ſhall they ſee the Son of man comming</hi> &amp;c. and in Revel. 16.20. <hi>Every Iſland fled, and the mountaines were not found,</hi> viz. in the day of judgement. For indeed all theſe things ſhall then really come to paſſe.</p>
                        <p>Now in other places, theſe expreſſions doe ſet forth allegorically horrible alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, or Gods great judgements, and thoſe eyther <hi>particular</hi> againſt the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Church: as in Iſay. 13.10. where the prophet ſpeaketh of the horrible overthrow <hi>of the Babylonians</hi> in theſe words: <hi>The ſtars of heaven, and the conſtella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:96676:88"/>thereof ſhall not give their light: The Sun ſhalbe darkned, and the Moon alſo ſhall not give her light.</hi> And again in Iſai. 34.4. <hi>And all the host of heaven ſhalbe diſſolved: and and the heavens ſhalbe rolled together as a ſcroll: and all their host ſhall fall down &amp;c.</hi> And from this place, as it ſeems by the like phraſe, the words here in our text are taken. Again in Ezech. 32.7. concerning the overthrow of Aegypt. <hi>I will cover the heavens</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>and make the ſtars thereof dark: I will cover the Sun with a cloud, and the Moon ſhall not give her light.</hi> Or <hi>univerſall,</hi> ſignifying the total com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of the Church: ſomtimes in a good ſence: ſometimes in a bad: and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in both.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>a good ſence;</hi> as in Hag. 2.7. &amp; Hebr. 12.27. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, yet once it is a little while, and I will ſhake the heavens, and the earth, and the drie land. And I will ſhake all nations: and the deſire of the gentiles ſhall come</hi> &amp;c. In which oracle is propheſied of an univerſall concuſſion, that is, of the reformation of the world by Chriſt; the which how it hath been, &amp; ſhall yet further be fulfilled, we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in our commentarie on <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.27.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>the evil part</hi> it is undoubtedlie taken in this place, as ſignifying the ſhaking of the heaven and earth, that is, the future corruption &amp; oppreſſion of the Church by Antichriſt. Now this concuſſion both in a good ſence by Chriſt, &amp; alſo in an ill ſence by Antichriſt is propheſied of by Ioel 2.28.

Even ſo Antichriſt puft up with baſe pride, &amp; lead by an evill ſpirit, hath ſhaken the Chriſtian world, overthrowen the ancient order and diſcipline of Chriſt, by changing the forme thereof into his <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie:</hi> the which tooke its beginning from the time of <hi>Pope Sylveſter I.</hi> For no ſooner were the <hi>Romiſh Biſhops</hi> by <hi>Constantine,</hi> and the following Emperours, ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up with outward dignitie and riches, but they hereupon ſwelling with ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, forthwith began to domineere, and lord it over their brethren: as the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of <hi>Sozimus, Zaeleſtinus, Leo,</hi> and others teſtifie: notwithſtanding this their
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:96676:88"/>great arrogancie was at firſt a little kept under, as by the authoritie of Emperours, ſo by the canon lawes, as alſo the oppoſition of other Biſhops: as may be ſeen by the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>ſixt council of Carthage:</hi> where the <hi>Pope of Rome</hi> aſſuming the name of <hi>univerſall</hi> unto his chaire, by authority (as he falſly affirmed) of the <hi>Nicean coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil:</hi> he was convicted of falſhood, and for that time repreſſed.</p>
                        <p>But after <hi>Gregorie,</hi> this ſpirit of pride violentlie burſt forth in <hi>Sabinian</hi> his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour, and after him in <hi>Boniface</hi> III. who was (as we ſaid before) openlie by <hi>Phocas,</hi> declared <hi>univerſal Biſhop,</hi> that is, Antichriſt was now lifted up on his throne. Then began all the <hi>bowels of the earth,</hi> that is, of the Chriſtian world to be horribly ſhaken. For now the <hi>whole clergie:</hi> is brought under the yoke of the Pope, who at length impoſed the law of abſtinence from marriage upon them: Now the <hi>doctrine of the Church:</hi> both concerning the worſhip of God as alſo the faith and free grace of Chriſt, is ſo corrupted as nothing almoſt remained ſound, but the bare name. Now the <hi>mountaines,</hi> viz. Emperours, Kings and Princes if at any time they diſpleaſe the Pope, are ſore ſhaken, yea troden under feet, by their <hi>buls,</hi> and excommunications. Now the <hi>Ilands</hi> alſo, that is, whole nations eſcape not, as we ſhall hear by and by. It would bee tedious to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat all the diſturbances and grievous calamities, which this <hi>Romane Antichrist</hi> hath brought, and yet daily deviſeth both againſt Church and common wealth.

We need not inſiſt upon hiſtories, ſeeing our owne daily experience doth ſufficiently ſet forth the meaning of this commotion.</p>

                           <hi>The Sun became black as ſack cloth of hair</hi>] This is the ſecond wonder. Chriſt the Sun of righteouſnes ſhalbe horriblie eclipſed, that is, the doctrine touching his offices and benefits darkned, and utterlie defaced. We heard before, how the Church loſt her <hi>whitneſſe,</hi> and became <hi>black</hi> in regard of the manie foule hereſies of that time: yet ſomething ſtill remained pure in her, by reaſon of ſome ſound teachers who firmlie maintained the truth of Chriſt. But under Antichriſt even the <hi>Sun</hi> is made <hi>black as ſackcloth of hair,</hi> that is, moſt black, and hurtfull. Not that Chriſt in himſelf can ſo be made: but becauſe Antichriſt by his profeſſion both teacheth and maketh ſuch a Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>It is thought, that the <hi>haire of ſackcloth</hi> here ſpoken of,
<note place="margin">What this ſackcloth of hair is.</note> is made of the black hair of goats, or horſes: whereof in former time they made mourning garments, as may be gathered from many places of ſcripture: theſe garments did prick the fleſh &amp; much paine thoſe that ware them. Hence the <hi>hypocriticall Monkes,</hi> as <hi>Carthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, Cappuzins,</hi> and other <hi>Antichriſtian frogs,</hi> (who glorie of perfection) weare ſuch garments for the beating down of their fleſh: but indeed hereby (as by a true badge) they teſtifie, that they live under the <hi>darkneſſe of the Sun</hi> here ſpoken of.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>(ſay they)</hi> Chriſt the Sun of righteouſnes is not darkned unto us:
<note place="margin">How the Sun is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſctired in popery.</note> For the Pope profeſſeth Chriſt to be God and man againſt all hereticks. I anſwer: If he ſhould openly caſt off the name of Chriſt, then he could not have brought the Chriſtian Church under his bondage, neither ſuppreſſe the truth as now he doth: But his comming as the Apoſtle witneſſeth,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.10.</note> is <hi>with all deceiveablenes of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in them that periſh.</hi> So that by the cunning pretence of Chriſtian profeſſion, he hath fraudulentlie overthrowne the Church: yea herein he hath mainly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Chriſt, in that he was looked upon to be a preacher of his name,

The profeſſion of Chriſts perſon, and of the trinitie, was indeed the maske under which he deceived the Church: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Chriſtians would have ſhunned him as the devill. But of what uſe, I pray you, is Chriſt without his offices &amp; benefits, the which in popery are troden under foot? what profiteth it to beleeve that the Turk is the Emperour of the Eaſt, from whom, unleſſe it be by thy own deceit, thou canſt not exſpect eyther good to thy ſelf or others?</p>

Yea ſay they,
<note place="margin">Papiſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve not on Chriſt as the onely mediatour.</note> we alſo profeſſe Chriſt to be the mediatour, redeemer and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaviour, &amp; by beleeving in whoſe merits we muſt be ſaved. But we have often ſhewed, that this their profeſſion is nothing but as <hi>black ſackcloth,</hi> if they would but ſee it: for if indeed they did beleeve Chriſt to be the onelie mediatour, they would not then have made to themſelvs ſo many thouſands of mediatours as they have don: For doe they not cry to <hi>S. Marie,</hi> to <hi>S. Peter,</hi> to <hi>S. Nicolas</hi> &amp;c. to pray for them? If they did beleeve to be ſaved by the merits of Chriſt alone: then they would not have forged the merits of ſaintes, neither their owne works of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, or of ſupererogation, or a purgatorie fire, and ſo aſcribe ſalvation, which is obtained by Chriſt alone, unto their owne inventions. Thus therefore the <hi>Sun,</hi> in Popery, is made <hi>black as ſackcloth of hair:</hi> The Apoſtolical doctrine of faith and ſalvation by them is <hi>darkned,</hi> and changed into Philoſophical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts: Chriſts ſacraments are <hi>darkned,</hi> and turned into a <hi>ſtage-playing Pompe</hi> or ſhew: The invocation and worſhip of God is <hi>darkned,</hi> and turned into adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of idols, and of the creature: To be ſhort the Church it ſelf is <hi>darkned,</hi> ſcarſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie retaining any thing of Chriſtianity except the bare name.</p>
                        <p>Now the <hi>black ſackcloth of hair</hi> doth ſignify the humane traditions, their hethea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and Iewiſh ceremonies mingled with Chriſtianiſme, of which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> complaines,

                           <hi>And the moon became as blood</hi>] The third wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der followeth; by the <hi>moon,</hi> is meant the Church, as Cant. 6.9. <hi>Fair as the moon.

Now what marveile is it, if the <hi>Moon</hi> be turned into <hi>blood,</hi> when <hi>the Sun is darkned?</hi> In Eclypſes the Moon appears black and reddiſh, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of a bloodie colour, having in it ſelfe but little light. But as the Moon doth receive its light from the Sun: ſo all light, puritie, righteouſnes and ſalvation, or whatever elſe the Church enjoyes, ſhee receiveth it all from Chriſt the <hi>Sun</hi> of righteouſnes. The ſence therefore is, that the Church ſhall be turned <hi>into blood,</hi> by the commotion of Antichriſt. The like phraſe the Lord uſeth in <hi>Joel</hi> 2.31. But whence comes this <hi>blood into the Moon?</hi> I anſwer: by the cruel tyrannie of Antichriſt, making the Church <hi>red</hi> with the blood both of the nations, and of the Saintes. For this <hi>blood</hi> was powred on her partly by wars, and partlie by martyrdoms. For the <hi>Pope</hi> not beeing content to uſurp the title of Peter the prince of the Apoſtles, &amp; under that pretence to terrify the world with his <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall lightnings,</hi> he hath alſo drawn out the temporall ſword againſt Emperours, kings, princes, and Chriſtian nations, filling all places with bloodie warres. As we may ſee <hi>in the extravagant of Boniface</hi> VIII. <hi>touching ſuperiority and obedience,</hi> where it is expreſſely ſaid, <hi>that the Church hath two ſwords, the ſpirituall and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill:</hi> and it is further added: <hi>that the ſpirituall is excerciſed by the Church: the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall by the hand of kings and ſouldiers according to the pleaſure and patience of prieſts,</hi> If this be true, then what are kings and ſouldiers, but the Popes vaſſals?

                              <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd the kings of the earth</hi>] Many (with <hi>Lyra</hi>) referre theſe things unto the times of <hi>Diocletian</hi> &amp; <hi>Maximianus,</hi> whoſe cruelty againſt the Chriſtians <hi>Euſebius</hi> treateth of <hi>Hiſtor. lib.</hi> 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9. becauſe in thoſe dayes men of all conditions &amp; eſtates, both great and ſmall, not beeing able to endure the extremitie of tyrants, ſought to hide themſelves in caves, mountaines and woodes. But they erre from the ſcope, &amp; in my opinion offer violence to the text: for undoubtedly by <hi>kings</hi> &amp;c. are not meant the vulgar, but men in place and authority. Now in thoſe times there were no Chriſtian kings, that we read of, to be perſecuted, or to ſhun theſe tyrants. Beſides the following words, <hi>hide us,</hi> and <hi>fall upon us,</hi> are not expreſſions of the godly groaning under the croſſe, but of the wicked, diſpairing for feare of wrath, as the cauſe annexed ſhewes: <hi>for the great day of his wrath is come:</hi> which cannot be poſſiblie underſtood of the day of the <hi>Diocletian perſecution.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Others therefore have thought, that theſe things appertaine to the laſt times, and the puniſhments of perſecutours. So Andreas, <hi>The kings,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>and all the princes, &amp; rich men, &amp;c. ſhall rather deſire to be hid in mountaines, rocks and caves, then to feele the wrath and ſcourges of the Lambe, which at Antichriſis comming ſhall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelme thoſe miſerable men: Or certainely they ſhall thus greatly quake for feare of the judgements prepared for them after the reſurrection of the fleſh, which never ſhall have an end.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Therefore this <hi>fourth Act of the viſion</hi> concerning the final puniſhment of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, is briefly annexed to the matter going before, and anſwereth ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the third Act, howbeit neyther this nor the third is yet fullie ended in this Chapter, as before we noted. For as the <hi>third Act</hi> hath two parts: the <hi>first</hi> ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth Antichriſts tyranny over the Chriſtian world, <hi>in the three former verſes:</hi> the <hi>other</hi> his reſtraint, and the ſealing of the elect afterward deſcribed in <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. So likewiſe the <hi>fourth Act</hi> conſiſts of two parts, both full of joy and conſolation to the Church: the <hi>firſt</hi> whereof deſcribeth the final and univerſal deſtruction of the wicked, in <hi>the three laſt verſes</hi> of <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. The <hi>ſecond</hi> ſets forth the happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which the ſaintes ſhall enjoy with the Lambe in heaven from <hi>v.</hi> 9. of <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. unto the end thereof.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="132" facs="tcp:96676:91"/>
Now we come to handle the puniſhment of the wicked, the which here is but briefly touched, but afterward more largely ſet forth in the following viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: The generall doctrine is this: that however the wicked for a while op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe and afflict the Church, yet they ſhall one day finallie periſh: their rage &amp; cruelty in ſeeking to deſtroy the godly, ſhall turn to their utter overthrow &amp; ruin: for ordinarily injury goes before deſtruction. Now the reaſon hereof is, becauſe God is juſt, &amp; will not ſuffer their crueltie to goe unpuniſhed: And alſo he is omnipotent, and able eaſily to caſt downe the kings of the earth, which have riſen up againſt him: to bee ſhort, he is faithfull and true, to performe the promiſed deliverance and glorie unto the ſaintes. Now here is deſcribed 1. The condition of the adverſaries: 2. their trembling and deſpaire: and thirdly the cauſe thereof.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And the kings] And,</hi> here is not ſo much copulative, as continuative or adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſative, for, <hi>then the kings:</hi> or, <hi>but the kings</hi> &amp;c. For it ſignifies the effect of this great <hi>Antichriſtian earthquake:</hi> we have not in this place, neyther Antichriſt, nor his falſe prophets and paraſites, by whoſe fraud he was advanced, here named: not as if they ſhould go unpuniſhed: but becauſe their deſtruction is purpoſely &amp; more manifeſtly deſcribed in the following hiſtory, and eſpecially in the fift and ſixt viſions, by many fearfull expreſſions.</p>
                        <p>Theſe here are named <hi>kings, great men, rich men, tribunes, and mightie men, and all bondmen and freemen,</hi> that is, both high &amp; low, all of the laicks (as they call them) of what degree ſoever, who have been inſtruments eyther by their authority or wealth to advance Antichriſt to that hight of tyrannie and cruelty, or who for the eſtabliſhing of his power, have drawen the ſword, or been helpfull in making or kindling of the fires wherin the martyrs were burnt.</p>
                        <p>But this alſo is to be extended more largely unto al the enemies of the Church, even from the beginning of the world,
<note place="margin">Who theſe kings and great men are.</note> viz. as well ſuch as perſecuted the godlie under the law, as <hi>Nimrod, Pharaoh, Saul, Ahab, Nebuchad-nezar, Antiochus</hi> &amp;c. as thoſe under the Goſpel, viz. <hi>Herod, Nero, Domitian, Trajan, Severus, Decius, Diocletian, Julian, Valens,</hi> and whoſoever elſe have bent their bow againſt Chriſt, and inſulted over his truth, or at this day, doe ſeek to uphold Antichriſt. But in the end, an unhappy and lamentable deſtruction ſhall come upon them.</p>
                        <p>Before we come to treat of this great <hi>cataſtrophe:</hi> I againe deſire the reader not to thinke it ſtrange, that we expounded the <hi>mountains</hi> &amp; <hi>Ilands</hi> ſpoken of in v. 14. to be kings and nations: though it ſeems that they are here onely expreſlie named: For before they were more obſcurelie and reſtrainedly ſet forth by the names of <hi>mountaines &amp; Iland moved out of their place by Antichrist,</hi> that is, by him ſeduced, ſhaken, and ſubjugated: but here in generall is prefigured the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of all enemies eyther under, or before Antichriſts time.</p>
                        <p>This alſo by the way we may take notice of, that <hi>Andreas</hi> underſtands by <hi>kings of the earth,</hi> them whoſe power and ſtudie onelie is in and about earthlie things, as having nothing to doe with Chriſt &amp; heaven.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Chief captaines</hi>] Gr. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> ſignifying, <hi>captaines over thouſands,</hi> ſuch (as among the Romans) had the chief charge over ſouldiers: for in a <hi>Romane Legion</hi> (which conſiſted of ſeven thouſand and ſomtimes more) there were ten bandes of ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: whereof the firſt bande was the greater, having 1105 footmen and 132 men of armes: and properlie ſuch as had charge over this bande were called <hi>chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarchi, collonels,</hi> or chiefe captaines. <hi>Vegetius lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de re milit. cap.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Every bondman</hi> and every <hi>freeman</hi>] that is, all other enemies of inferiour ranks, who were ſtrong to ſhead the blood of the ſaintes, and to perſecute &amp; blaſpheme the Goſpell: now fearfull indeed, ſhall be the end of every one of them, as it followeth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And hid themſelves in the dens</hi>] Wee read that the godlie in times of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion often fled into mountaines, woodes and deſerts, hidings themſelves there for fear of tyrants, as the hiſtorie of the Machabees, and others witneſſe. But
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:96676:91"/>here, not the godly under perſecution, but the perſecutors themſelves are ſpoken of: as is plainly to be gathered by what followeth: <hi>they hid themſelves in dens,</hi> that is, they now ſhall doe that themſelves, which formerly they conſtrained the ſaintes to doe: it ſignifies their extreem fear and perplexity: as not knowing where to turn themſelves for to finde any ſuccour. Now their kingdoms, palaces, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, and munitions of warre: now their armies, legions, militarie bandes, &amp;c. cannot helpe them: but in vain doe they fly unto <hi>dens</hi> &amp; <hi>rocks,</hi> which ſhall not be open to receive and hide them. And therefore they ſhall deſpairinglie cry, <hi>Ah fall on us, and hide us</hi>] The voyce of men without hope of mercy and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and wiſhing that which no wiſe man would deſire: to wit, to be cruſhed under the mountaines and miſerablie brought to nothing.</p>
                        <p>This is <hi>a proverbial</hi> deſcription of the wicked deſpairing, by which is intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that ſuch ſhall be the horrible appearance of things, as that they ſhall an hundred times rather deſire any cruel death, then with ſuch a dreadfull diſtraction &amp; feare of preſent puniſhment enjoy the light any more. Three times in ſcripture we finde theſe expreſſions. <hi>Once in Hoſea</hi> 10.8. concerning the overthrow of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael by the <hi>Aſſyrians. Secondly in Luke</hi> 23.30. touching the deſtruction of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem: and <hi>thirdly</hi> in this place about the final puniſhment of reprobates. And this here is rightlie applied to the like miſeries, becauſe in their cauſes they are all alike. For of old this exclamation was fulfilled in the wicked Iſraelites, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſt both into temporal &amp; eternal puniſhment. Afterward it was alſo verified in the deſtruction of the city, and the utter overthrow of the Iewiſh nation, and ſhall moſt fullie be accompliſhed at the day of judgement: when the wicked ſhal hear that fearfull ſentence pronounced: <hi>Goe ye curſed into the eternal fire, which is prepared for the devill and his angels.</hi> Then ſhall they burſt forth into theſe words of deſpaire: <hi>Mountaines fall on us:</hi> as thinking it better for them once to be cruſhed by the mountains and brought to nothing, then for ever to be tormented in flames of hell fire.</p>
                        <p>But here, I cannot ſufficiently wonder at the falſe and impious interpretation of <hi>Lyra, Gagnaeus</hi> and others, who are not aſhamed to applie that unto the martyrs &amp; ſaintes in heaven, (thereby to eſtabliſh their blaſphemous invocation on ſaintes departed) which the ſcripture plainly attributes unto reprobates deſpairing of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Theſe <hi>cryes</hi> they wil have to be made by the martyrs under the <hi>Diocletian perſecution:</hi> The <hi>mountaines &amp; the rockes,</hi> to be the <hi>Saintes,</hi> called <hi>mountaines,</hi> becauſe of their exaltation unto heavenly things. Vnto them the godlie in their ſtraights and anguiſhes ſhall cry: <hi>fall on us:</hi> that is, come to us, and help us in our perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Hide us:</hi> that is, protect us by praying unto God for us. But what a horrible depravation of ſcripture is this? We know that the godly martyrs in their perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution by prayer fled unto God ſitting on the throne, &amp; unto the <hi>Lambe</hi> ſtanding in the midſt thereof, that is, Chriſt the onely ſaviour: But for any worſhip to be rendred unto fained ſaintes the martyrs and others of the faithful were altogether ignorant of. For what can be imagined more wicked then that the martyrs in their greateſt anguiſhes, leaving God &amp; Chriſt, ſhould implore the help of the creature, againſt the expreſſe commandement of God, <hi>call upon me in the day of trouble &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>From the face of him that ſits</hi>] There are three cauſes of this their great fear and deſperation. The ſight of God &amp; the Lamb: the day of judgement: and an evill conſcience. Touching the firſt no marvaile, ſeeing <hi>God is a conſuming fire,</hi> &amp; the wicked are as ſtubble which the fire eaſely conſumeth &amp; brings to nothing.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And from the wrath of the Lamb</hi>] No where in ſcripture is wrath attributed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lamb, but in this place, &amp; here it noteth that reve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging juſtice proper to God alone,
<note place="margin">XXXII. <hi>Argum. of Chriſts deity.</hi>
                           </note> which the wicked ſhall tremble at when the Lamb ſhall pronounce the ſentence, <hi>go yee curſed</hi> &amp;c. Now here the Godhead of the Lamb is evidently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ſeeing Antichriſt and his wicked inſtruments doe, and ſhall ſtand in fear of none but of God onely omnipotent, as is confirmed by the following reaſon.</p>
                        <p n="17">
                           <pb n="134" facs="tcp:96676:92"/>
17 <hi>For the great day of his wrath is come</hi>] This is the ſecond cauſe of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keds horror.
<note place="margin">This great day of God and the Lamb, is the day of judgement.</note> For in the day of judgement being asked a reaſon of their ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe &amp; cruelty co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, they ſhalbe mute &amp; ſtand aſhamed. They who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this <hi>great day</hi> otherwiſe then of the laſt judgment, doe groſlie deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But <hi>Alcaſar</hi> applying this to the Iewiſh people, is more ridiculous, who would mingle an hiſtorie knowen unto the whole world with theſe propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call types. In the mean while let the reader obſerve the relative <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>of his anger,</hi> evidentlie proving (as before we ſhewed) the deitie of Chriſt. For that great day of wrath, or of judgements, eſpecially of the laſt judgement, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where in the ſcriptures called the <hi>great day of Jehovah. Ier.</hi> 30.7. <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.11.31. <hi>Zepha.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.20. Now here this day is called, <hi>The great day of the Lambs wrath.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And who ſhall be able to ſtand</hi>] The third cauſe of their trembling, is an evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience againſt God, Men, &amp; the ſpouſe of the Lamb. The words are taken out of <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.11. For <hi>the day of Jehovah is great and terrible, and who can abide it.</hi> Even the godlie themſelves break forth into the like ſpeeches, when they looke upon the rigour of Gods judgements: <hi>If thou ſhouldest obſerve iniquitie O Iehovah, who ſhall ſtand?</hi> but this they ſpeake with a filial fear, and humbling of themſelves, and not with horror, deſpairing as doe the wicked. <hi>To ſtand in judgement,</hi> is to rely on the confidence of a good cauſe, and to be abſolved or quitted: as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, <hi>Yeſterday we ſtood well in the Senate.</hi> Not <hi>to ſtand,</hi> is to looſe ones cauſe, and to be condemned, according to the Pſalmiſt, <hi>the wicked ſhall not ſtand in judgement.</hi> Pſ. 1.5. <hi>ſo againe the fooliſh ſhall not ſtand in thy ſight,</hi> Pſa. 5.5. Hence they here cry out, <hi>Who?</hi> that is, none of Gods enemyes, &amp; the Lambs, ſhallbe able to ſtand. Thus we have heard the <hi>Acts</hi> of Antichriſts tragical end: now followes the happie and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful change of the church; the ſealed &amp; holy ones ſhal ſtand before the throne, ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God and the Lamb: <hi>Salvation bee to our God, &amp;c.</hi>

                           <hi>The four Angels ſtanding on the four corners of the earth, &amp; holding the four winds of the earth,</hi> he interprets of four Emperours, great perſecutors of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who (after <hi>Diocletian</hi> and <hi>Maximianus</hi> had laid downe the Empire) affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the Church in many parts of the world at one time: <hi>Maximianus</hi> in the Eaſt: <hi>Severus</hi> in Italie: <hi>Maxentius</hi> at Rome: <hi>Licinius</hi> of Alexandria in Aegypt: theſe <hi>held the windes,</hi> that is hindered the teachers of the Church, that they <hi>ſhould not blow,</hi> that is, preach Gods word: for as by the blowing of the windes the earth is made fruitfull: ſo the preaching of the Goſpell fructifyeth the garden of the Church militant.

                           </hi> he underſtands Chriſtians, ſome dwelling in firme lands, ſome in Ilands, &amp; others in woods for to avoyd perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Angel having <hi>the ſeal of God,</hi> &amp; forbidding to <hi>hurt the earth, and ſea,</hi> is <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great, bearing the ſigne of the croſſe in his enſigne, and reſtraining thoſe four tyrants from hurting of Chriſtians. For <hi>Conſtantine</hi> at length overcame <hi>Maxentius, Licinius,</hi> and other their fellow tyrants, and having obtained the empire alone, he ſigned many thouſand in the forehead, that is, beeing converted unto the faith of Chriſt, he beſtowed many great priviledges upon the Church, &amp; ſigned many thouſands, that is, cauſed them to be baptiſed with the ſigne of the croſſe on their foreheads.</p>
                        <p>This interpretation I thus far approve of,
<note place="margin">What is approvable in Lyras in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> namely, that the windes ſignifie prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and the blowing of the windes, Gods word preached: and the holding of the windes, the hindring of Goſpell in the courſe thereof. But for his application of the reſt unto the ſhort ſpace of thoſe four tyrants it agrees little to the ſcope, ſeeing thoſe things were to happen a long while after under Antichriſt, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the circumſtances, and as the comparing of theſe things with the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing viſions will more clearly manifeſt. Beſides hee erreth in making <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> this ſealing Angel, foraſmuch as undoubtedlie the outward ſigne of the croſſe is not here at all intended, but a higher myſterie concerning the preſervation of the elect, and their ſeparation from the abominations of Antichriſt, leaſt they ſhould be defiled thereby; as will more plainly appear by the matter following.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Rupertus</hi> refers this unto the four kingdoms of the world hindring the faith of Chriſt: viz. the <hi>Babylonian, Perſian, Greek</hi> &amp; <hi>Romane</hi> Empires: but this is too general.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Andreas</hi> (herein agreeing with moſt of our interpreters) doth more rightlie applie it to the times of Antichriſt: to which <hi>Ribera</hi> alſo conſenteth, but yet in this he erreth, viz. in that he thinks that the following contents of this booke are to be applyed to the four yeares reigne of his ſuppoſed Antichriſt. For generally the following viſions doe plainlie repreſent the foregoing four Acts of the hiſtory of the Church from Iohns time even unto the end, under other figures: he alſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth from al others in taking theſe to be good Angels, which are here ſpoken of: wheras all others agree, that they are evill Angels. Notwithſtanding in this they doe generallie erre thorow an erroneous ſuppoſition, in reſtraining the time of Antichriſt unto the laſt four yeeres of the world, conſidering that Antichriſt hath allreadie reigned above a thouſand yeares, even from <hi>Boniface</hi> the third, who (as
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:96676:93"/>we have already ſhewed) was the firſt that profeſſed himſelf <hi>univerſall priest,</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving unto his ſucceſſors this moſt wicked title and mark of Antichriſt.</p>
                        <p>But to let paſſe theſe mens opinions, we here take notice of a ſecond part of the <hi>third Act</hi> of viſion II. wherein <hi>Iohn</hi> is informed of the ſtate of the godlie during the <hi>earthquakes,</hi> and Antichriſtian commotions. For having ſeen before things horrible and prodigious, even a violent alteration of all ſtates of the Chriſtian world under Antichriſt, he having I ſay ſeen <hi>Mahumet</hi> in the Eaſt, and the <hi>Romiſh Biſhops</hi> in the Weſt oppreſſing the Church by fire and ſword, and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their decrees and idols upon all, depraving Chriſtian religion by their mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold traditions, heatheniſh and Iewiſh ſuperſtitions, in ſo much as unto the Churches of the Weſt was left almoſt nothing, but the bare name of Chriſt. Now leaſt Iohn (ſeeing theſe things) ſhould thus have thought with himſelf: what ſhall Chriſt be thus oppreſt and kept under by Antichriſt? ſhall there bee no more a Church? no more ſincere preaching? no more faithfull &amp; valiant teachers to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Antichriſt? ſhall indeed the elect alſo be drawen away into errours, of whom Chriſt ſaith, that it is impoſſible they ſhould be ſeduced? Now hence it is that this preſent ſight of the <hi>blowing windes,</hi> and of the <hi>four Angels</hi> labouring in vain to hinder their operation, is exhibited unto him: ſhewing how the godlie ſhould continually oppoſe Antichriſt: and be ſealed in their foreheads, ſignifying their ſafety and preſervation unto the end.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Alcaſar</hi> preſuppoſeth (howbeit not truly) that theſe things appertaine unto the <hi>ſeventh ſeale:</hi> but it is repugnant unto the very text in Chap. 8.1. and though it did, yet would it no way help the conſequence which thence he draweth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Four Angels ſtanding</hi>] Now concerning theſe <hi>Angels,</hi> let us ſee, who they are,
<note place="margin">Who are theſe four Angels.</note> what they did, and the cauſe thereof. By <hi>theſe Angels,</hi> I underſtand Satan &amp; his Angels, by whoſe powerfull working Antichriſt invaded Chriſts kingdom, and eſtabliſhed his owne with <hi>all deceit of unrighteouſneſſe:</hi> and withall I underſtand all Antichriſts agents, both <hi>eccleſiaſticall</hi> and <hi>ſecular,</hi> as Kings and Emperours who (to uphold his kingdom) have laboured by fire &amp; ſword to ſuppreſſe the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel: ſo likewiſe <hi>Cardinals, Biſhops, Monkes, Canoniſts, Inquiſitors,</hi> &amp; <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> who deceiving the world under an angelicall ſhew of holineſſe, have ſtronglie advanced his kingdome: theſe are <hi>four</hi> (a definite number beeing put for an indefinite) as alluding to the foure corners of the earth on which they <hi>ſtand,</hi> that is, have their <hi>Biſhopricks, Lordſhips, Colledges</hi> and <hi>Fraternities</hi> there fixed. Now by <hi>four corners</hi> the whole earth is meant, and here it noteth that no place ſhall be free from the miſchievous deviſes of theſe wicked Angels.</p>
                        <p>Others again interpret theſe Angels <hi>ſtanding on the four corners of the earth,</hi> after this manner. The <hi>Mahumetans</hi> in the Eaſt who ſuppreſſed the doctrine of Chriſt: for however they ſeem to permit the <hi>European Christians</hi> the freedom of their religion, yet the ſame is don deceitfully, as thereby the eaſier to draw the reſt of the Chriſtian world under their power, and ſo if they could altogether to blot out the very name of Chriſtianity. The South they underſtand to be the verie ſeat of the <hi>Romane Antichrist:</hi> The North is poſſeſſed by the Popes ſworn vaſſals. And the Weſt by <hi>the Spaniard</hi> (his firſt begotten ſon) and the <hi>most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian French king</hi> (as they ſtile him) all which have hithertoo mightily hindered the windes from blowing upon the <hi>earth, ſea,</hi> &amp; <hi>trees.</hi> But we may as fitlie applie this to the Popes <hi>ſpirituall Angels</hi> ſtanding upon the four corners of the earth, ſeeing he hath every where his <hi>Legates a Latere,</hi> his creatures (I ſay) to maintain his Antichriſtian primacie, and to hinder the blowing of the windes, by their frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent deviſes, preachings, writings, diſputations, miracles, &amp; all manner of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by deceit and unrighteouſneſſe.</p>
                        <p>The reaſon why <hi>Ribera</hi> contendeth, that not evill Angels, but the good,
<note place="margin">Riberas opinion weighed.</note> are here intended, is to free <hi>Antichrists miniſters</hi> from ſuſpicion. But moſt Popiſh wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters doe hold the contrarie. <hi>Mart. Delrius libr.</hi> 2. <hi>mag. diſquiſ. quaeſi.</hi> 11. thinkes them to be very hurtfull &amp; pernicious devils. <hi>Alcaſar</hi> would faine refute him,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:96676:94"/>but his tongue will not let him, &amp; therefore he leaves it undecided whether they bee good or evil: at laſt he faineth a dream of <hi>four Aeoluſes,</hi> brideling the windes with bonds and impriſonment. Now is not this a worthie expoſition of this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie?</p>
                        <p>But Ribera wil maintain his opinion with arguments, <hi>The devils,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are not in corners of the world, but in the midst of the great men of the earth, in provinces and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to be ſhort, whereſoever they bee they hinder the preachers of Gods word:</hi> As if <hi>Iohn</hi> underſtood not this ſame thing by the four corners of the earth. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore too childiſhlie reſtraines theſe <hi>corners of the earth,</hi> unto the utmoſt places, or mathematicall centers thereof, foraſmuch as by a <hi>ſynecdoche</hi> the whole world is here ſignified.</p>
                        <p>But he further objecteth, that <hi>God is wont to puniſh the world not onely by evill Angels, but alſo by the good Angels: as we ſee Gen:</hi> 19. <hi>and</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 <hi>King</hi> 19. <hi>&amp; Iſai.</hi> 37. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Auſtin alſo confirmeth <hi>lib.</hi> 9. <hi>de Civ. D. c.</hi> 5. but it ſufficeth, that for the moſt part it is don by the evill.</p>
                        <p>Neither is there any weight in this, <hi>that the other Angel as joyning himſelf with them, ſaith;</hi> VNTIL WE HAVE SEALED THE SERVANTS OF OVR GOD, for he makes not the Angels which were readie to hurt the earth, &amp;c. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions with him in ſealing, but cloſelie he pointes out the good Angels which were preſent with him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Holding the foure windes that they ſhould not blow</hi>] Now he ſhewes what the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels did: in which we are to conſider, what the <hi>four blowing windes</hi> are, and what is meant by <hi>the earth, ſea and trees:</hi> and how they held the windes from blowing on the earth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ribera</hi> underſtands it properlie of the four cheife windes,

Therfore he ſuppoſeth that hereby is ſignified the outward calamities falling upon the perſecutours of the ſaintes: &amp; his reaſon is, becauſe the literal ſence is to be followed, except a plaine reaſon doth neceſſitate the contrary. Now indeed this is true; notwithſtanding if we ſhould always expound the viſions of this booke litterally, much abſurdity would follow thereupon: beſides the following words doe yeeld us a manifeſt ground that the letter here is not to be obſerved: for the elect are ſaid to be ſealed, &amp; thereby to be freed from hurt. Now we know that the godly are not free from outward ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, as peſtilence &amp; famine, wherby the earth, ſea &amp; trees are hurt: &amp; therfore it doth neceſſarily follow, that we muſt underſtand it of an immunity of another kinde of hurt.</p>

                        <p>The <hi>earth, ſea,</hi> and <hi>trees,</hi> I underſtand allegorically, not of the faithfull in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, or learned men onely, but of diſtinct churches.

The reaſon why I take this to be meant of whole churches, is, becauſe the <hi>Angels</hi> are forbid to hurt them, until ſuch were ſealed, as the Lord had appointed: and afterward they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to doe it. Therefore the ſealed ones ſhalbe in the <hi>earth, ſea,</hi> &amp; <hi>trees,</hi> that is, in thoſe Churches that are hurt, nevertheleſſe they beeing ſealed ſhalbe preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in ſafetie.</p>
                        <p>But how ſhall they hold the windes from blowing, and to what end?
<note place="margin">What is meant by holding the windes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> blowing.</note> This may bee underſtood by the following words, <hi>It was given them to hurt the earth and the ſea:</hi> and again, <hi>hurt not the earth, ſea, nor trees.</hi> So that they ſhall hold the windes from blowing: when the Angels who profeſſe themſelves to be ſpirituall Biſhops, &amp; ought to blow, ſhall neyther preach the Goſpell, nor ſuffer others: but oppoſe them by their Popiſh decrees and edicts, by their excommunications, by cruell perſecution with fire and ſword, as againſt hereticks: forbidding the reading &amp; uſe of the holy Scriptures unto all men, leaſt the deceits and lyes of Antichriſt ſhould be made manifeſt. Hence neceſſarilie followed the hurt of <hi>the earth, ſea &amp; trees:</hi> for the wholeſome blowing of the windes now ceaſing, all the churches were led into errours by the contrarie blowing of ſeducing ſpirits, and lying pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, who brought al under the yoke of Antichriſt, to the deſtruction of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of Chriſtianity.

                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> though Antichriſt by violence and deceit hath horribly ſhaken the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world, doing much harme unto the <hi>earth</hi> and <hi>ſea:</hi> yet God at all times, rayſed up ſome <hi>good windes,</hi> that is, faithfull teachers who taught the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome doctrin of Chriſt, to the ſalvation of the elect, as the hiſtories of Popes &amp; bookes of martyrs teſtifie. Yea the Lord did preſerve unto himſelf a Church in the midſt of Poperie, which Antichriſt could never altogether ſuppreſſe, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he cruellie by fire and ſword continuallie raged againſt the ſame. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is falſe that God had no Church, nor Chriſt any ſpouſe: becauſe the Pope and his ſynagogue were not the ſpouſe of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> we ſee by what wayes Antichriſt did invade Chriſts kingdome, and eſtabliſh his owne tyrannie: to wit, <hi>by holding the blowing of the windes,</hi> in condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for haereticks, &amp; violently oppreſſing the witneſſes of the truth, as alſo by hurting the <hi>earth, ſea &amp; trees,</hi> that is, ſeducing all the particular Churches by falſe
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:96676:95"/>miracles with all deceit of unrighteouſnes, overthrowing them by his impious do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and ſuperſtitious worſhip, of which the Apoſtle foretold 2 Theſſa. 2.9. ſaying, <hi>whoſe comming is after the working of Satan, with all power, and ſignes, &amp; lying wonders, and with all deceiveablenes of unrighteouſneſſe in them that periſh,</hi> &amp;c. theſe things wee find in hiſtories formerlie to have been don, and we daylie ſee the further accompliſhment thereof, which ſerves for a cleare expoſition on theſe words: now let us hear the antidote or conſolation oppoſed.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>And I ſaw another Angel] First</hi> we will conſider who, &amp; what manner of Angel this was, and ſecondly what he did.</p>
                        <p>One Angel <hi>having the ſeale of the living God,</hi> aſcendeth from the Eaſt againſt the four Angels ſtanding on the earth. <hi>Lyraes</hi> opinion in expounding this of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> we have already refuted. Others ſuppoſe that <hi>Elias</hi> ſhall come towards the end of the world, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                           <hi>Malachie</hi> ſpeaketh <hi>Cha.</hi> 4.5. But their ſuppoſition is falſe, as we ſhall ſee on <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. for the prophet there ſpeaketh of <hi>Iohn the Baptiſt,</hi> as Chriſt himſelfe interpreteth <hi>Matt.</hi> 11.14. moſt underſtand it of Chriſt the great Angel of Gods counſell: as <hi>Rupertus, Haymo, Bede</hi> &amp; others. <hi>Ribera</hi> indeed denies it, and will have him to bee one of the ſeven emiſſarie Angels ſpoken of <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.6. but he gaines nothing by his denial: neyther need we to contend at all about it:
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>The Angel aſcending from the Eaſt is Chriſt Luk.</hi> 1.78. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4.</note> For it is all one whither we underſtand it of Chriſt himſelfe, or of his Angel mentioned <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.1. &amp; 22.16. However it ſeems rather to be meant of Chriſt, in that it is ſaid, <hi>he aſcends from the east.</hi> For Chriſt is the ſun of righteouſnes ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from on high, and he it is that <hi>hath the ſeale of the living God:</hi> for he is the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the inviſible God, the brightneſſe of his glory, &amp; the Character of the perſon of the Father. <hi>Sealing the elect,</hi> becauſe in him wee are choſen before the foundation of the world. Alſo <hi>hee ſealeth,</hi> becauſe he giveth faith unto the Elect, juſtifies, regenerates, &amp; ſanctifies them, ſealing in their hearts the witneſſe of the ſpirit, that they may not be ſeduced by the guile of Antichriſt. Now foraſmuch as theſe things are proper unto God, I rather underſtand this to be ſpoken of Chriſt then of any created Angel.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>ſeale</hi> which he imprints on the Elect,
<note place="margin">What the ſeale of the living God is.</note> the Apoſtle explaineth 2 Tim. 2.19. <hi>the foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, having this ſeale, the Lord knoweth who are his.</hi> Moreover that this is to be underſtood of Chriſt, it may be probablie gathered, becauſe this viſion is like unto that in <hi>Ezech.</hi> 9. where the Prophet ſaw ſix men, every one having a ſlaughter weapon in his hand for to deſtroy Ieruſalem. He ſaw alſo one man among them clothed in linnen with a writers inkhorn by his ſide, to mark ſuch with the ſigne <hi>Thau</hi> on the forehead, as mourned for all the abomination committed in the city, that is, all the godlie, who were not pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with idolatrie. Now here all interpreters underſtand Chriſt the mediatour. Neyther doth it any way contradict what we ſay, in that Chriſt is ſayd to be the <hi>Lambe opening the ſeale:</hi> for (as we have ſhewed Chap. 5.2.) it is not ſtrange, that he ſhould be repreſented in diverſe formes in this <hi>viſionall Revelation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>He cryed with a great voyce</hi>] This angel doth two things. <hi>First,</hi> with <hi>a great cry</hi> he forbids the evil Angels <hi>to hurt the earth, ſea and trees,</hi> adding a limitation: <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he had ſealed the ſervants of God:</hi> the ſence is, ſeeing thoſe that were to be ſealed are the ſervants of God, therefore power of hurting is not given unto them, till this ſealing be finiſhed, leaſt they ſhould bee promiſcuouſly wrapt in the danger of ſeducement, and ſo be deſtroyed with the reſt. <hi>Secondlie,</hi> he ſealed an hundred fourtie and four thouſand of the twelve tribes of Iſrael. This <hi>great cry</hi> denotes Chriſt power over Antichriſt and his inſtruments, whoſe madneſſe he ſo bridleth, as that they cannot by their tyrannie proceed further, then what is permitted them. And therefore it is ſaid; <hi>to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the ſea.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Hence it appeareth in the <hi>first place,</hi> why they <hi>held the windes from blowing:</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wit, that they might <hi>hurt the earth and the ſea,</hi> that is, deſtroy the Churches by peſtilent doctrine. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that the devil howſoever he doth forciblie ſtirre up Antichriſt unto crueltie againſt the Goſpel, and endeavours to blot the elect out of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:96676:95"/>the booke of life, yet he can do no more, then <hi>is given unto him,</hi> that is, no more then what is graunted him by Chriſt <hi>the Angel of the East.</hi> Now the Apoſtle teacheth us 2 Theſſa. 2. that the power which is given him, is over them that periſh.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. <hi>Hurt not the earth</hi>] what is meant by the <hi>earth, ſea &amp; trees,</hi> I have already ſhewed. The enemies of the windes are commanded, not to hurt theſe: ſo that we ſee they cannot rage &amp; dominere as they liſt:
<note place="margin">Antichriſt hath taken poſſeſſion of the Churches of Chriſt.</note> neyther is Antichriſt ſtronger thon Chriſt, although he hath invaded his Churches: For it was don by permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion onely. Now the reaſon thereof we muſt not too curiouſly ſearch into. But acknowledg that the ſecurity, ungodlineſſe and ingratitude of Chriſtians deſerved the ſame, as the Apoſtle ſhewes 2 Theſſ. 2.11. <hi>For this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſion, that they ſhould beleeve a lye: becauſe they received not the love of the truth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Till we have ſealed</hi>] to wit <hi>I, and my miniſters.</hi> For Chriſt is not without his miniſtring ſpirits: But whither he had now more Angels with him as <hi>Ezech.</hi> 9.2. or not, the ſame is not expreſſed. He doth not ſimplie forbid them to hurt, but limits the time, and untill that prefixed time theſe deſtroyers could do nothing. Thus Antichriſt hath not hurt <hi>the earth, ſea and trees,</hi> that is, by his Angels brought the particular Churches of the Weſt under his yoke, eyther againſt the will, or knowledge of Chriſt, but by his ſufferance: neyther could he hurt them ſooner then Chriſt would; nor ſhall he be able to doe it any longer then it ſeems good unto him. Now touching this ſealing we are briefly to conſider: who were ſealed, when, with what ſigne, wherefore and how manie.</p>
                        <p>Who they are, he ſhewes, ſaying, <hi>untill we have ſealed the ſervants of our God:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Who are theſe ſealed ones.</note> theſe are the elect in Chriſt, who worſhip not idols, or Antichriſt, but God in faith and true obedience.</p>
                        <p>This ſealing is partly eternal, &amp; partly accompliſhed in time.
<note place="margin">What this ſealing is.</note> From eternity God hath ſealed all them that ſhall be ſaved in the counſell of praedeſtination, which is made &amp; founded on Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.3. In time he <hi>ſealed</hi> his, when now for a thouſand yeeres he ſtirred up many witneſſes of his truth &amp; faith, beeing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with true knowledge, excellent gifts, &amp; heroick boldnes, who ſtoutlie op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the impoſtures of Antichriſt, by their preaching and writing, &amp; preſerved very many faithfull ones from his <hi>idol worſhip.</hi> But chiefly he hath and doth ſeale in theſe laſt times, in reſtoring almoſt in all the provinces of the Chriſtian world, the loſt truth of the heavenlie doctrine by his ſervants and excellent divines, who have diſſipated the miſt of popery by the light of the Goſpell, and purged many Churches in <hi>Germanie, France, England, Denmark, Poland, Bohemia, Moravia,</hi> &amp; <hi>Hungarie,</hi> from Antichriſtian pollutions, plucking them as a prey out of the jawes af the devill.</p>
                        <p>I confeſſe indeed that all the members of theſe Churches are not elected: nevertheleſſe they are all ſeparated from Antichriſt, ſo that he cannot hurt them; yea we doubt not but that a great number of them appertain unto the election of grace.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Ezech.</hi> 9.4.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Ribera</hi> will have it to be meant of the <hi>ſigne of the croſſe.</hi> Now we know that many who are ſigned with the <hi>popiſh croſſe</hi> are the bondſlaves of Satan: but none of theſe here ſealed ſhall periſh: ſeeing they are marked to this end, that no man ſhould hurt them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Alcaſar</hi> ſaith wel, that <hi>this is no external ſigne, which may bee diſcerned with corporal eyes, neyther is it made by any created Angel, but immediatelie by the holy Ghost, who himſelf marketh ſuch with the ſigne of the living God, to whom he graciouſly communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates himſelf.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Let us therefore underſtand it of the ſeale ſpoken of 2 Tim. 2.9. <hi>The foundation
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:96676:96"/>of God ſtandeth ſure having this ſeale, the Lord knoweth who are his: and let every one that calleth upon the name of God depart from iniquity.</hi> This ſeale Chap. 14.1. is ſaid to be the <hi>fathers name, written in the foreheads of the ſaintes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First</hi> therefore this <hi>ſeale</hi> imprinted in the elect, is Gods eternal purpoſe to ſave them: the which however it is not ſeen by the eye of man, yet the elect both diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, and feel the ſame in their hearts. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is a ſaving vocation unto faith, and wrought externally by the word &amp; ſacraments, internally through the earneſt of the ſpirit. <hi>Thirdlie,</hi> it is a true invocation on the name of God, that is, a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere profeſſion of the truth, by forſaking and deteſting al the known wayes of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt. <hi>To be ſhort,</hi> it is a true converſion unto the Lord, conſtancy &amp; perſeverance in the faith of Chriſt. By theſe notes the <hi>ſealed ones</hi> ſeparate themſelves from the dregs of Antichriſt, and are eaſily known from all other men: therefore they are ſaid to be <hi>marked in their foreheads,</hi> becauſe they are not at all aſhamed of their holy profeſſion.</p>
                        <p>But wherfore is this <hi>marke</hi> put upon them?
<note place="margin">The uſe of their ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> I anſwere, to the end that they may not be hurt by the <hi>evil Angels,</hi> nor ſeduced by Antichriſt, &amp; led into errour, &amp; ſo made partakers of his plagues. That Antichriſt, I ſay, may have no intereſt in them: for beeing ſealed, they are ſecure, &amp; certaine of their ſalvation in middeſt of all confuſions and ruins. This is matter of ſingular comfort to the elect, in that their ſalvation is certaine, &amp; that the Lord careth for them. Agreeable hereunto is that in <hi>Ezec.</hi> 9. where the marked ones are preſerved, while the city in the mean time is deſtroyed. And <hi>Rahab,</hi> having her houſe marked according to the covenant with the ſpies, eſcapeth: So <hi>the Iſraelites ſprinkling their poſts with the blood of the Paſchal Lamb</hi> were delivered, while the firſt born of Egypt periſhed, therfore it is ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.4. that the locuſts only hurt them, <hi>which had not the ſeal of God in the forehead.</hi> For Antichriſt alſo doth mark his ſervants with his <hi>character,</hi> as we ſee <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. but not to the end they ſhould be preſerved, but to have power to buy &amp; ſell his <hi>holy wares,</hi> make marchandiſe of mens ſoules, &amp; trade in his kingdom. Now this <hi>Character</hi> ſhall not ſecure them that are marked therwith from deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but rather draw down Gods judgements upon them: for <hi>the beaſt, &amp; the falſe prophet, &amp; all that have received his mark ſhall be caſt into the lake of fire &amp; brimſtone,</hi> Rev. 19. &amp; 20.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And I heard the number of them that were ſealed</hi>] their number is great: yet leſſe then the number of locuſts, &amp; ſuch as had the mark of the beaſt in their forehead &amp; right hand. Nevertheles much greater then men <hi>imagine</hi> &amp; judge: a definite for an indefinite. For alwayes there have, are, &amp; ſhall be more witneſſes of the truth, then Antichriſt or the world knowes of: a Church, I ſay of ſealed ones preſerved by thy Lord unto himſelf; as in the time of <hi>Elias ſeven thouſand in Iſrael were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, who had not bowed the knee to Baal,</hi> albeit the Prophet then complained that he was onely left. The Papiſts inquire who, &amp; where the Church was before <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers time?</hi> let them receive here an anſwer from Iohn: that when Antichriſt thought he had brought al to ſtoope under him, yet then the Lord hath 144000 <hi>ſealed ones.</hi> We affirme therfore that a Church of ſealed ones was hid in the midſt of popery, even when the Angels ſtood on the four corners of the earth to hinder the windes from blowing (that is, to hinder the courſe of the Goſpel) &amp; to ſubject all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches under the power of Antichriſt. Moreover the number here ſpecified is moſt perfect, twelve &amp; ten beeing by the rule of Arithmeticke put together. For twelve beeing multiplied by ten, makes a hundred &amp; twentie: &amp; ten times a hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and twentie, makes twelve thouſand, which is the number that was ſealed out of each tribe: this againe beeing multiplyed by twelve, makes a hundred fourtie &amp; four thouſand, which is the compleet number of all them that were ſealed. For other myſteries I let them paſſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Out of all the tribes of Iſrael] Ribera</hi> underſtands it literally of the converſion of ſo many Iewes out of every tribe, about the laſt times under Antichriſt, proving
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:96676:96"/>it from that of the Apoſtle Rom. 11.26. <hi>and ſo all Iſrael ſhall be ſaved.</hi> But in this he agrees, neyther with himſelf, nor yet with the oracle of Paul. For if ſo bee that all the Iewes ſhall receive and follow Antichriſt as the Meſſias (as the Papiſts themſelves imagine) how then ſhall ſo many thouſand cleave unto Chriſt? And againe, if all Iſrael ſhall be converted, how then ſhall there bee onely 144000 ſealed ones? the propheſie of the Apoſtle I will not here ſpeake of, as not apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to this place, and the rather becauſe in my <hi>commentarie on the Romanes</hi> I have expounded the ſame.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Lyra</hi> ſpeakes of the converſion of ſo many Iewes under <hi>Conſtantine:</hi> but yet he dares not affirme, that ſuch a thing was then accompliſhed, &amp; therfore he approves of a myſticall interpretation, and applies it to the ſpirituall Iſrael, that is, to ſuch as were converted to the faith of Iſrael &amp; of Chriſt under <hi>Conſtantine;</hi> But I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved that theſe things may not be tyed to that time, but belong to the ages after under Antichriſt.</p>
                        <p>There are alſo ſome of our interpreters who expound this number 144000 of beleeving Iewes, and applie the great multitude ſpoken of v. 9. to the Church of the gentiles.</p>
                        <p>But leaving ſuch mens opinions, I follow the expoſition of my <hi>Anonymus: of all the tribes of the children of Iſrael, that is of all nations imitating the faith of Iſrael: becauſe God hath elected ſome to ſalvation out of every part of the world:</hi> Chriſt alſo ſhall have his ſealed ones, in all places where Antichriſt reigneth. Beſides the beleevers of the Gentiles are often in the new Teſtament called by the name of Iſrael, as following Iſraels &amp; Abrahams faith. Rom. 4. &amp; 9.6. <hi>For they are not all Iſrael which are of Iſrael</hi> &amp;c. Now theſe are compared to the twelve tribes of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, becauſe they ſucceeded in their place: &amp; therefore it is ſaid they ſhall <hi>ſit on twelve thrones to judge the twelve tribes of Iſrael,</hi> who were apoſtated from God and Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>The diſtribution therefore of theſe ſealed ones, according to their tribes, is not to be taken litterally, but by a certaine ſimilitude, becauſe God hath ſubſtituted other ſpecial nations, in ſtead of thoſe apoſtatical tribes, in which he hath a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine number <hi>of ſealed ones,</hi> that is, ordained to life eternal. And the reaſon hereof is apparent: becauſe the twelve carnall tribes of Iſrael before the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this <hi>Revelation,</hi> were loſt by the deſtruction of Iudea and Ieruſalem: much leſſe doe they remaine to this day: For touching the ſmall remainder of the Iewes now in their diſperſion, it is altogether uncertaine of what tribes they are.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore <hi>Andreas</hi> (whom my <hi>Anonymus</hi> followeth) applies certaine vertues to each tribe, from the Etymologie or ſignification of their names: as for example: <hi>the ſealed of the tribe of Judah are confeſſours of Christ: the ſealed of Reuben are the pure in heart enjoying the heavenlie viſion.</hi> But I paſſe this by, as beeing more ſubtil then ſolid: as for the ſignification of their names read <hi>Gen.</hi> 29. &amp; 30. &amp; 35. Now twelve thouſand are ſealed of every tribe, for many are choſen by Chriſt out of all peoples and nations under Antichriſt.</p>
                        <p>The naturall order of the tribes is not here obſerved.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Judah</hi> is put before <hi>Ruben,</hi> both becauſe it was the kinglie tribe of which Chriſt came according to the fleſh: as alſo becauſe <hi>Reuben</hi> by defiling his fathers bed loſt his birthright. So at the numbring of the people, &amp; pitching of the campes <hi>Iudah</hi> had the preeminence. Num. 2.3. &amp; 1 Chron. 4.</p>
                        <p>The tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> contrarie to the ordinarie cuſtom of the Scripture is here brought in: for he had no inheritance with the reſt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ephraim</hi> againe is omitted, and <hi>Joſeph</hi> is here placed in his ſtead, contrarie to the order of the tribes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Dan</hi> alſo is paſſed by: the reaſon whereof moſt of the fathers and ſome alſo to this day will have to be, becauſe Antichriſt ſhould come of this tribe: grounding their opinion, on that in Gen. 49.17. <hi>Dan is a ſerpent in the way:</hi> &amp; Iere. 8.16.

Moreover the former were ſealed: viz. during the perſecutions of Antichriſt on earth: but theſe latter ſung a hymne, to wit, after the enemies were caſt into utter darkeneſſe, and the Church taken up into glory.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore five things are recorded concerning this multitude. 1. Who, how great, where, &amp; what manner of multitude it was? v. 2.2. What they did?
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:96676:98"/>they prayſe God and the Lamb. v. 10.11.12. 3. Who they were? The martyrs &amp; faithfull before ſealed. v. 13.14. 4. What their happineſſe was. ver. 15.16. 5. The cauſe of this their great felicitie. v. 17.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>A great multitude which no man &amp;c.</hi>] This multitude is a figure of the new triumphant Church: ſo that it conſiſted both of the ſoules which Iohn erewhile ſaw under the altar, namely who in this world had fought the good fight of faith, from the time of the Apoſtles for the ſpace of 600 yeeres: as alſo the hundred fourty and four thouſand ſealed ones, preſerved by Chriſt during the troubles and commotions of THAT MAN OF SIN, from the ſixhundreth yeere, unto the end of the world. This multitude is <hi>great &amp; innumerable,</hi> as conſiſting of all the forenamed perſons. viz. both of the martyrs under the altar, and of the hundred fourty and foure thouſand ſealed ones, with all other of the faithfull from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles time unto the laſt day.
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19.</note> The which number, although it be ſmall in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of them that periſh: and certaine and defined in reſpect of God (who knowes who are his) yet in it ſelf it is great, &amp; cannot bee reckoned by any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Howſoever therefore the greater part ſhall follow the devill, and cleave to Antichriſt: yet the Lord will have a great multitude, and by ſuch he will bee prayſed for ever.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Of all nations</hi>] Thus alſo the Church in <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.9. ſingeth unto the Lord: <hi>Thou haſt redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred, &amp; tongue, &amp; people, and nation.</hi> Hence we ſee, that the ſealed of the twelve tribes of Iſrael, belong to this multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: otherwiſe they could not bee of every tribe &amp; nation. So that here is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the whole triumphant Church of the new Teſtament.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Stood before the Throne</hi>] This ſhewes that they were in heaven, and not on earth: for this <hi>ſtanding</hi> denotes their coeleſtiall happineſſe, which conſiſteth in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall viſion of God &amp; the Lambe. The queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> counted <hi>Solomons</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants happie, in that they alwayes ſtood before <hi>Solomon,</hi> and heard his wiſdome: but how much greater is the happines of the Saintes in heaven, who continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behold the majeſty, and glory of God and Chriſt? Now this <hi>ſtanding of the Saintes</hi> is oppoſed to the dreadfull cry of reprobates, <hi>who can ſtand?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Clothed with white robes</hi>] Their heavenlie purity, brightneſſe and glorie is here ſet forth: For <hi>the just ſhall ſhine as the ſtars of heaven.</hi> Hence againe it appeareth that the ſoules of the Martyrs, to whom <hi>white robes were given Chap.</hi> 6.11. and to whom it was ſaid that <hi>they ſhould rest for a little ſeaſon,</hi> are joyned to this multitude, beeing commanded to come forth from under the altar, and placed before the Throne. Moreover <hi>palms</hi> were given into their hands, in ſigne of victorie. For as <hi>Gregorie</hi> obſerveth, theſe <hi>palms which the multitude held in their hands, are nothing els but the reward of victorie following the workes of Martyrs.</hi> Yet God forbid, we ſhould with <hi>Ribera</hi> attribute this reward, to any meritorious worke: ſeeing a far other meritious cauſe thereof is noted unto us ver. 14. &amp; 17.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. <hi>And cryed with a loude voyce</hi>] Now followes what this multitude did: they together with the <hi>Angels, Elders,</hi> &amp; <hi>Beaſts,</hi> that is, with the whole aſſembly of the heavenly inhabitants, ſing joyfullie to God &amp; the Lambe. This joy of the Saintes, as I even now ſaid, is oppoſed to the howling of the ungodly under their plagues: <hi>Mountaines fall on us.</hi> Here therfore is ſignified the moſt certaine change of things as now they are, joyfull indeed and deſirable unto the godlie, now under affliction: but dolefull and curſed to the wicked, now lifting up their hornes: <hi>For it is a righteous thing with God</hi> (ſaith Paul) <hi>to recompence tribulation to them that trouble you:
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.6</note> and to you who are troubled, rest with us,</hi> &amp;c. According as Abraham ſaid to the glutton crying in hell:

                           <hi>Salvation to our God</hi>] This acclamation is not a wiſhing ſalvation, as is the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſubjects, deſiring proſperity to their prince, to cry: <hi>Let the king live:</hi> but a ſhouting for joy, &amp; a bleſſing of God and the Lambe, for mans ſalvation, or bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed immortality and happineſſe: It is (I ſay) no wiſh; but an action of thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:96676:98"/>attributing to God that which is dew unto him, namely, the prayſe and glorie of their ſalvation: and the ſence is: <hi>we aſcribe not our ſalvation received, to our owne power, but to the grace of God &amp; merits of the Lambe.</hi> Therefore <hi>Beza</hi> to expreſſe this ſence, hath rendred the words thus: <hi>ſalvation from our God and from the Lambe,</hi> to wit, <hi>is given unto us:</hi> And thus <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his 11 <hi>ſermon</hi> concerning the Saintes: <hi>They ſing with a loud voyce ſalvation to God, who acknowledge with much thanksgiving, that they have overcome in battle all fierie trials, not by their owne power, but by his aſſiſtance</hi> &amp;c.

                     <hi>This viſion therefore is alſo univerſall, conſiſting of four Acts: and is of the ſame argument or nature with the former viſion, prefiguring the ſucceſſe of the preaching of the Goſpell: what enemies the Church ſhould have: what battels ſhould befall the godly teachers in the world, eſpecially un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the kingdome of Antichriſt: alſo comfort and remedie by which the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ought to raiſe up themſelves in the midſt of ſo great confuſions.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>This interpretation both I my ſelf, and moſt of our writers approve of, as moſt true. For this Angel ſtandeth, and performeth in heaven the work of the Churches
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:96676:102"/>high prieſt, in offering up the prayers of the Saintes and making them accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, as a ſweet ſmelling ſacrifice: Now the Church hath no other <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priest,</hi> but Chriſt alone: &amp; therefore <hi>Ribera</hi> in applying this, not to Chriſt, but unto a created Angel, robs him of the honour of his prieſthood, and makes the Saints in heaven as mediatours to be praied unto. But this wicked invention is contrarie both to this viſion, and the whole drift and ſcope of the <hi>Revelation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>His objection, that Chriſt is no where in ſcripture abſolutely called an Angel, is falſe: for he, who delivered the Patriarch <hi>Jacob</hi> out of all his troubles, is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely called an <hi>Angel</hi> Gen. 48.16. which muſt be underſtood of Chriſt Iehovah, the Sonne of God, as appears by Gen. 32.9.11. &amp; 28.15. &amp; in Mala. 3.1. Chriſt is called <hi>the Angel of the covenant.</hi> Neyther is it true, that <hi>John</hi> makes him like one of <hi>the ſeven Angels</hi> here ſpoken of. For he calls him <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <p>Thus we have the meaning of the <hi>preparation:</hi> Before the <hi>ſeven Angels</hi> ſhould ſtirr up the world by ſounding their trumpets, Chriſt ſteps in as the high-prieſt, for to offer up to God the prayers and groanes of the Church militant againſt ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants &amp; Antichriſt: to teach us that the complaints of the faithfull vaniſh not away in the ayre, but are received by Chriſt our mercifull highprieſt, &amp; by him effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually offered, &amp; preſented before God, thereby to procure deliverance for them. This is the lively comfort of the Church, that ſhe hath an <hi>highpriest</hi> to fly unto in all her troubles.</p>
                        <p>But as yet it doth not ſufficiently appear, how theſe things agree with what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth: &amp; therefore we will more narrowlie conſider the matter.</p>
                        <p>That which the <hi>ſeven Angels</hi> ſhall afterward more diſtinctly ſet forth by ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their trumpets:
<note place="margin">The myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Angel with the golden cenſer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</note> This Angel (as I before ſaid) as a certaine forerunner in a general way, ſhadowes out the ſame. For as Iohn in the beginning of the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing viſion ſaw Chriſt riding, and crowned as king of the Church, and conquerour of al enemies, firſt on <hi>a white horſe,</hi> afterward on a <hi>red,</hi> thirdlie on a <hi>black,</hi> &amp; at laſt <hi>on a pale:</hi> ſo now he ſees Chriſt ſtanding at <hi>the altar</hi> as the highprieſt of the Church, offering to God the prayers of the Saintes, and ſending into the earth the fire of the ſpirit, &amp; preachers of the Goſpel, at the ſound of whoſe trumpets ariſe voyces, thundrings and lightnings, prefiguring the ſame thing, which in the former viſion was typed out by the <hi>white, red, black</hi> &amp; <hi>pale horſe,</hi> viz. the diverſe ſtate &amp; condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church: and at laſt followeth a <hi>great earthquake.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Chriſt therfore the high prieſt of the Church, the heavenlie author &amp; directour of the miniſtery, is here repreſented unto us, that wee may be aſſured, that while the preachers on earth doe ſound the trumpet of the word, Chriſt performeth for them, and for the whole Church the part of an highprieſt in heaven. Now let us conſider the words themſelves: in which is propounded I. <hi>What this Angel did in heaven.</hi> II. <hi>With what ſucceſſe he did it.</hi> III. <hi>What followed thereupon in the earth.</hi>

                           <hi>All what he did in heaven,</hi> is accommodated to the types of the Old Teſtament. For as the prieſt beeing to pray and offer for the people, went to the golden per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumatorie altar, on which was preſerved the continual fire, and taking a golden cenſer, put incenſe thereon, the which beeing kindled by the fire of the altar was reſolved into an odoriferous ſmoake acceptable to God: So <hi>John</hi> ſees Chriſt ſtanding in the heavens, <hi>at the Altar,</hi> But in heaven there is no <hi>Altar,</hi> except Chriſt himſelf; ſee <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.9.</p>

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:96676:102"/>given to Chriſt, when as the prayers and groanes of the Saintes aſcend upward unto God in the name of Ieſus Chriſt: The word <hi>giving</hi> here uſed, doth not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue that this Angel is not Chriſt, for he himſelf profeſſeth that <hi>all things are given unto him of his Father,</hi> to wit, as man and mediatour: And indeed in him are hid all the treaſures of grace, the which he diſtributeth according to the neceſſity of all his members, ſo that he needs not to take any incenſe other where.

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:96676:103"/>Apoſtles, in the likenes of fiery tongues. And this I take to be the caſting of the fire of the Altar into the earth. I know that ſome underſtand it of the fire of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion which ſhould follow the preaching of the Goſpel, wherof Chriſt ſpeaketh, <hi>I am come to ſend fire on the earth,
<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.49.</note> and what will I, if it were already kindled?</hi> But ſo it can not be, becauſe the high-prieſt with this fire had formerly kindled his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe. <hi>The ſecond benefit</hi> is the caſting of the cenſer upon the earth, which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyeth (as I have ſhewed;) the pretious death and paſſion of Chriſt. This he ſent into the earth, when the whole world was filled with the knowledge of Chriſt crucified, by the preaching of the Apoſtles.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>caſting</hi> therefore of <hi>this cenſer</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is the ſame with that of Chriſts riding as conquerour on the white horſe:</hi> by which (as we have ſhewed <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.) is ſet forth the Goſpel preached by the Apoſtles, &amp; the <hi>whitenes</hi> of the primitive Churches, that is, their purity in life and doctrine.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And there were voyces and thundrings]</hi> This alſo by moſt is taken in an evill ſence, namely for the plagues of the wicked: But it ſignifies the diverſe events of the Church occaſioned by the preaching of the Goſpell, and indeed the very ſame thing was before ſet forth, at the opening of the <hi>firſt, ſecond, third, fourth,</hi> &amp; <hi>ſixt ſeale:</hi> yet ſo, as in a general way onely: The order of the words is here to be noted. The <hi>old verſion</hi> puts <hi>thundrings</hi> in the firſt place, and <hi>voyces</hi> in the ſecond: but all Greek copies read <hi>voyces</hi> firſt.</p>
                        <p>Firſt therefore, <hi>there were voyces]</hi> That is, the preaching of the Goſpel had a bleſſed ſucceſſe, while the voyces of the Apoſtles ſounded throughout the earth, drawing the whole world, as it were unto the obedience of Chriſt: agreeable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this, is that before ſpoken of, concerning Chriſts glorious riding on the <hi>white horſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>Thundrings,</hi> this was noted by the <hi>red horſe,</hi> whoſe <hi>rider tooke away peace from the earth,</hi> that is, by the preaching of the Goſpel rayſed up the <hi>thundrings of tyrants.</hi> For looke as thunder ſhakes, ſtrikes and tears the higheſt mountaines: ſo did the tyrants firſt terribly rage againſt the Apoſtles, afterwards by axe and ſword ſlew many thouſands of good Chriſtians.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, there were <hi>Lightnings,</hi> fyerie flaſhes, which burnt, and made pale &amp; black the ſtanding come. This was ſhadowed out by the <hi>black and pale horſe,</hi> the Church beeing darkned by the <hi>lightnings</hi> of hereſies, &amp; by the flouriſhing ſhewes, and deceites of <hi>hypocritical monks,</hi> was brought into an irrecoverable palenes or death.</p>
                        <p>To be ſhort there follows <hi>an Earthquake]</hi> to wit, that great one ſpoken of at the opening of the <hi>ſixt ſeal,</hi> meaning that Antichriſt ſhould ſhake the Chriſtian world, as <hi>Mahomet</hi> in the Eaſt, and the <hi>Pope</hi> in the Weſt.</p>
                        <p>Here we may learn in the <hi>first place,</hi> that Chriſt our faithfull high-prieſt doth alwayes appear in heaven before God for his Church, and by the golden cenſer, that is, by the eternal efficacie of his oblation, intercedes for us to the Father, make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our prayers acceptable unto him: ſo that neyther Satan, nor Antichriſt ſhall ever be able to deſtroy the Church whatſoever in their rage they imagine againſt her.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> that the prayers of al the Saints both in heaven and in earth, are offered up by Chriſt, and by him onely made acceptable to God. Therefore it is great impiety, to direct our prayers to the Saints, as thinking by them, to have them offered unto the Lord.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>In the last place,</hi> if we ſee in theſe our dayes <hi>thundrings, lightnings,</hi> &amp; <hi>earthquakes</hi> to follow the preaching of the Goſpell, let us not be offended (ſeeing <hi>John</hi> hath foretould us hereof) onely let us in ſuch times fly unto Chriſt our high-prieſt by prayer and true repentance.</p>
                        <p n="6">6 <hi>And the ſeven Angels which had]</hi> That which before was ſhewed in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral way to follow after the caſting of the cenſer full of fire into the earth (ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the powring out of the holy Ghoſt upon the Apoſtles, and their preaching of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:96676:103"/>the Goſpell) namely the voyces, thundrings, &amp;c. He now comes to ſet down in a more ſpeciall way, by types indeed for the moſt part obſcure, yet not ſo hard to be underſtood, if we diligently compare them with hiſtories.</p>
                        <p>The Angels prepare not themſelves to ſound, before that Chriſt had caſt his cenſer of fire into the earth; Now what is this? but the commandement given unto the Apoſtles not to depart from Hieruſalem to preach the Goſpell,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Act.</hi> 1.4.</note> untill they had received the holy Ghoſt. For all theſe <hi>trumpettours</hi> as before we ſhewed, are the Apoſtles, &amp; all other faithfull teachers in the after ages, except the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth &amp; laſt onely, which ſhalbe the Archangel himſelf.</p>
                        <p>And as the apparition exhibited to Iohn in the former viſion, ſerved to unfold the myſteries of all the <hi>ſeales:</hi> ſo theſe here ſerve for the underſtanding of the ſound of all the trumpets, which thing we are principally to obſerve, laying it down for a ſure ground, that both there and here are ſignified by a certain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogie, partly the ſame, and partly the like events to befall the Church from that time unto the end. For Chriſt intended to reveal no other events unto Iohn,
<note place="margin">There is an analogy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſeales, trumpets &amp; vials.</note> then what he had ſeen before: neyther can there be any queſtion made, but that there is a certain agreement betwixt the <hi>ſeven ſeales, ſeven trumpets,</hi> &amp; <hi>ſeven vials,</hi> if we diligently conſider every particular, and rightly attend to the ſcope of the propheſie.</p>
                        <p>Here then we ſee, that they altogether erre from the drift of this hiſtorie, who applie <hi>the ſeven trumpets</hi> to the ſeven greateſt judgements of God, which have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len upon the world, ſince the creation: as <hi>the first trumpet,</hi> to note the overthrow of <hi>Sodom and Gomorrha by fire. The ſecond</hi> to the drowning of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the red ſea. <hi>The third</hi> to the Canaanites beeing deſtroyed by Ioſuah. <hi>The fourth</hi> to the murmuring Iſraelites in the wildernes. <hi>The fift</hi> to the Iſraelites fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away from God, in the times of the judges. <hi>The ſixt</hi> to Ieruſalems deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Romanes. And laſtly <hi>the ſeventh,</hi> to the everlaſting puniſhment of all the wicked at the day of judgement. But theſe things are altogether beſides the matter: For wherefore ſhould Chriſt now again repreſent that unto Iohn in obſcure types, which formerly he plainely knew by hiſtories of old. Therefore we ſhall come nearer unto the mark, if we obſerve that theſe trumpets began, from the Apoſtles time, and ſo ſhall continue untill the end of the world. Now let us hear the trumpets.</p>

For the earth is divided (as it were) into three parts, viz. Iewes, Pagans, and Chriſtians: this interpretation is not abſurd, and therefore approved of by <hi>Bullinger</hi> and ſome others: but hence the analogie betwixt the ſeales and trumpets doth not appear: neyther is it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the <hi>firſt Angel</hi> began not to found till 300 yeeres after Iohns time: but
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:96676:104"/>undoubtedly it was preſentlie upon Chriſts caſting the fire into the earth.</p>
                        <p>I therefore doe compare the firſt trumpet to the firſt ſeal.
<note place="margin">The firſt trumpet anſwereth to the firſt ſeale.</note> For as Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is ſaid <hi>to ride on a white horſe</hi> as a conquerour, having <hi>a crown on his head,</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the proſperours ſucceſſe of the Goſpell, and in his hand the <hi>bow</hi> of his word, by which he moved, wounded, and converted whole nations unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: ſo here a contrarie effect is ſhadowed out in reſpect of the enemies of the Goſpell: to wit, the grievous contradictions &amp; perſecutions rayſed by the Iewes in all places againſt the Apoſtles. For the Gentiles readily inbracing the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, moved the Iewes through envie, tumultuouſly to rage, and raiſe up much miſchiefe in every place againſt the Chriſtians; the which is here ſet forth by <hi>the haile and fire migled with blood,</hi> alluding unto the ſeventh plague of Egypt: <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.24. beeing a grievous haile mingled with fire, and the blood of men and beaſts, conſumed by it. <hi>Haile</hi> is a congeling of the water in the ayre through cold, and it is very hurtfull unto the ſtanding corne. <hi>Fire,</hi> is contrarie to haile: <hi>Blood,</hi> ſignifyes cruelty. At the ſounding therefore of the <hi>first trumpet,</hi> which began by the preaching of the Apoſtles on the day of Pentecoſt, there fell <hi>haile, fire and blood,</hi> that is, contradictions, perſecutions, baniſhments, and ſlaughters through the obſtinate Iewes: as the <hi>Acts</hi> &amp; <hi>Epistles</hi> of the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, with other hiſtories doe plainely prove. Now the reaſon, why I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre this (with the <hi>Catholick Gloſſe</hi>) unto the Iewes and other tumultuous adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, viz. ſuch as had loſt their civill power, ſhall appear by the following trumpet.</p>
                        <p>Now familiarly in ſcripture by haile, fire and blood are noted popular and common calamities, as <hi>Joel</hi> 2. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1. and in other places. But the following effects touching the burning of the <hi>third part of the trees, and of the green graſſe</hi> cauſeth me to expound this of the calamities befalling the godly, and not of the puniſhments of the wicked: becauſe undoubtedly this is to be applied to the ſufferings of the Saints.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And the third part of trees was burnt up]</hi> by <hi>the trees</hi> I underſtand the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> &amp; chiefe teachers: by <hi>all green graſſe,</hi> the Saintes of the primitive Churches. For the godly are compared to <hi>fruitfull trees planted by the rivers of waters</hi> Pſal. 1.3. and to <hi>graſſe,</hi> noting their imbicillitie and weaknes, yet <hi>green,</hi> becauſe of their lively faith and charitie. Of theſe <hi>the third part</hi> was burnt up, that is, multitudes of them were hurt, afflicted and murdered by their adverſaries, the perfidious Iewes. For as tempeſtuous haile and lightning is verie hurtfull to the trees and graſſe of the earth: even ſo at the firſt beginning of the Goſpell, the Apoſtles &amp; the reſt of the faithfull were exerciſed with cruel ſtormes of afflictions, wherby a great part of them was taken away. The phraſe ſeems to have an allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion unto that of <hi>Ezech.</hi> 5.2. where the Prophet is commanded, to cut of the <hi>haire of his head and beard, and to burn a third part with fire, to ſmite a third part with a ſword, and to ſcatter a third part in the winde,</hi> under which type the Lord threatned grievous plagues unto the Iewes for their rebellion.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And all green graſſe was burnt up]</hi> Not <hi>all</hi> ſtrictly, but a great part: for often times <hi>all</hi> in ſcripture, is put onelie for a part, not for the whole. In ſaying the <hi>green graſſe,</hi> it notes the extreem calamities of thoſe times. For the dry hay may more eaſely be burnt, then the green graſſe, or wood. <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.31. Hence it appeares that this affliction was verie grievous. How long this trumpet ſounded, I will not preciſely define, but thinke that is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended from the firſt preaching of Goſpell mentioned <hi>Act.</hi> 2. untill the times of <hi>Domitian,</hi> who was the firſt of the Romane Emperours (<hi>Nero</hi> except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) that perſecuted the Chriſtians. But the Iewes afflicted and perſecuted them many wayes.</p>
                        <p>The ſpecial uſe of this firſt trumpet belonged to Iohn &amp; the primitive Church, that they ſhould not (though living under the <hi>white horſe</hi>) promiſe delight, &amp; eaſe unto themſelves, but prepare for cruel ſtormes of afflictions, notwithſtanding
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:96676:104"/>this was their comfort that howſoever by the cruelty &amp; lightnings of the wicked, the third part ſhould be burnt up: yet two parts ſhould remain unhurt. In gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall it appertaineth unto us alſo, that we having the primitive Church for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, ſhould not be offended if we be brought to the like condition: but be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, that the Lord will ſtill preſerve ſome Churches notwithſtanding the rage of Antichriſt, who for a long time hath tyranniſed over our Anceſtours, &amp; with whom we yet wreſtle unto this day.</p>

This <hi>mountain was cast into the ſea,</hi> that is violently niſhed upon the world, (not indeed of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers,) but of true belevers, that is, the Chriſtian Church, when as the Romane Emperours, as <hi>Domitian, Trajan, Severus, Diocletian, Maximianus</hi> and others (imitaring the tyranny of Nero) perſecuted the ſaintes, even untill <hi>Conſtantines time.</hi> What followed hereupon? <hi>The third part of the ſea became blood]</hi> that is, as we heard before at the opening of the <hi>ſecond ſeale,</hi> the Church was made <hi>red</hi> with the blood of martyrs, ſo here <hi>this mountaine</hi> with a fierie rage oppreſſeth many thouſands of ſaintes.</p>
                        <p n="9">9 <hi>The third part of the creatures died]</hi> Theſe are the ſlaughters &amp; Martyrdoms of infinite Chriſtians, put to death by the Romane tyrants for the confeſſion of the name of Chriſt. And there is an allegorical analogie betweene the ſea and creatures in it: &amp; the Church, and faithfull living in the ſame.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And the third part of the ſhips were deſtroyed]</hi> by ſhips we underſtand the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches with their <hi>pilots,</hi> or teachers: for by ſhips Churches are ſignified, many wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were then loſt and deſtroyed with the Apoſtles, Biſhops &amp; their worthy tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers; theſe, I ſay, were cruſhed through the weight of this <hi>great mountaine,</hi> not indeed eternally, but corporallie onely. Now touching this, we are to conſult with the Eccleſiaſtical hiſtories of the Churches perſecutions (of which we have ſpoken ſomewhat on Chap. 6.) which wil ſerve for an excellent commentarie on this place. Certainely the <hi>ſhip,</hi> or Church at <hi>Rome</hi> was in a ſpecial manner made <hi>red</hi> with blood: for all her biſhops or teachers (as it is recorded) unto <hi>Melchiades,</hi> ſuffered Martyrdome under thoſe tyrants. Thus therefore <hi>this trumpet</hi> allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally explaineth the efficient cauſe of the <hi>ſecond horſes</hi> redneſſe, and further ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the grievous outragiouſneſſe thereof.</p>
                        <p>But what reaſon is there,
<note place="margin">Why onely one third of the ſea was made blood.</note> that the whole ſea was not turned into blood, and that all creatures &amp; ſhips died, &amp; periſhed not, but onely a third part? I have ſhewed that this manner of ſpeech is taken out of <hi>Ezech.</hi> 5.2. Now there the Prophet is commanded, not onely to deſtroy one third part of his hair, but the three thirds thereof, thereby ſignifying a totall deſtruction: But here the <hi>mountaine</hi> ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make <hi>red</hi> one third part of the ſea, and kill the third part of creatures, &amp; cauſe
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:96676:105"/>the third part of ſhips to periſh, which undoubtedly was for the comfort of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the faithful: for however this <hi>mountaine</hi> were great, and ruſhing with a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty violence labours to fill all places with fire and blood, yet ſhould he be able to hurt but one third part of the Chriſtian Church. For two thirds ſhalbee preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in ſafety.</p>
                        <p>And the truth hereof is confirmed by hiſtories:
<note place="margin">The fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of this type.</note> for both in Rome and all other kingdomes, the greater part of Chriſtians were ſafely kept in the midſt of the moſt dangerous &amp; cruel perſecutions, yea the blood of the martyrs was as it were the ſeed of the Church, for the more Chriſtians were put to death by tyrants, the more their number increaſed, in ſo much that many times even the executioners themſelves beholding the confeſſion, courage, &amp; conſtancie of martyrs, became Chriſtians, and obtained the ſame crown of martyrdom with them.</p>
                        <p>Moreover it is for the Churches comfort that this <hi>burning mountain</hi> is caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſea: for by water the fire is extinguiſhed. However therefore tyrants doe much rage for a time: yet at length they ſhall periſh, the victory ſhall remain on the Churches ſide: for <hi>by faith we overcome the world</hi> 1 Ioh. 5.5.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Catholick Gloſſe</hi> interprets this <hi>mountain</hi> (not unfitly) of the Romane Empire, <hi>great</hi> indeed, yet thrown into the ſea, which is much greater,
<note place="margin">The ſea ſwallowed up this great mountain.</note> and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth and deitroyes the ſame. By <hi>the ſea</hi> he underſtandeth <hi>Chriſts kingdom,</hi> of far greater power then the Romane, ſignifying that the Romane tyranny ſhould be ſwallowed up by Chriſts kingdome: for however Chriſt ſeems to bee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in his afflicted members, yet in truth he conquereth all his tyrannical ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaries, for <hi>the gates of hell ſhall not prevaile againſt the Church</hi> Matt. 16.18. Thus ſad and joyfull things are here mixed together, by which we ſee, that the ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this viſion touching the bloody condition of the Church, is not in vain.</p>
                        <p>Moreover I underſtand the ſounding of this trumpet to be from <hi>Domitians</hi> time (under whom Iohn was baniſhed) untill <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> who repreſſed the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of his Copartners in the Empire, and reſtored peace unto the Church, about the yeere of our Lord 312.</p>

                        <p>Now howſoever all theſe differ and erre in the hypotheſis, or ſpeciall applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: yet they all agree in the theſis, or generall poſition, neyther, (as I judge,) doe they herein erre from the ſcope.

                        </p>
                        <p>Others referre this to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> but they little obſerve the circumſtances of the trumpet.

                        <p>My opinion therefore touching the <hi>third trumpet,</hi> is, that this <hi>great ſtarre burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like a lampe,</hi> falling from heaven, and turning the third part of the waters into <hi>wormewood,</hi> in a generall way denoteth all apoſtated Arch-hereticks, ſpoken of <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. Who at the opening of the third ſeale, for the ſpace of ſix hundred yeeres after the time of the Apoſtles, deformed the Church of Chriſt by their foul hereſies, and brought deſtruction upon the four corners of the earth by their blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, errours and tumults, as we have before declared. For it is plain that by <hi>ſtarres,</hi> the teachers of Churches are ſignifyed, and by <hi>falling from heaven,</hi> their apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſy from the true faith. But <hi>ſpecially,</hi> by this <hi>ſtarre,</hi> and his <hi>fall from heaven,</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly ſignifyed the <hi>apoſtaſie of the Biſhop of Rome,</hi> not indeed that <hi>univerſall</hi> departure,
<note place="margin">The apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tafie of the Church of Rome.</note> which followed afterward at the full riſing of Antichriſt, but that firſt defect, which three hundred yeers before forcibly occaſioned &amp; led the Churches both of the Eaſt and Weſt, by little and little to ſubmit to Antichriſt, namely, from the time of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> unto <hi>Phocas</hi> the intruder. For the <hi>Biſhops of Rome</hi> in regard of the great renowne and chiefe honour of that citie (it being the ſeat of the Romane Empire) were eminent lights among their fellow biſhops: hence the <hi>starre</hi> is called <hi>great, burning like a torch or lampe.

                           <hi>Hee did fall.</hi> Hee ſaw him here not quite <hi>fallen,</hi> as in Chap. 9.1. but falling: for as yet the Romane ſea was onely declining, or in the motion of its Apoſtaſie. Before <hi>Silueſter,</hi> thirtie and one Biſhops of Rome for the moſt part like <hi>ſtars</hi> in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment brightly ſhined both in learning, faith, Pietie and conſtancie: yea they all ſuffered Martyrdome under the Romane tyrants. But after that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had graunted peace unto Chriſtians, and enriched the Churches by his too much libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallity, heaping wealth and honour exceedingly upon biſhops: then began this <hi>ſtar</hi> (ſwelling with pride and ambition) like <hi>Lucifer</hi> to lift up himſelfe above his
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:96676:106"/>fellow miniſters to bee wholy given to voluptuouſneſſe, to fill and burthen the Churches with Iewiſh and heatheniſh rites and ordinances, &amp; ſo by forſaking the truth of the Goſpell, altogether to embrace humane traditions.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sylyeſter</hi> was the firſt (if hiſtories may bee credited) who gave himſelfe wholy to the inſtitution of their Maſſe-prieſts, orders, ornaments, temples, ſinging-men, ſacrifices, ſanctuaries, veſtments, ointments, ſurpliſes, miters, embroidered gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the like Babyloniſh ſtuffe, bringing all theſe idle rites into the Church, under this pretence, partly, leaſt Chriſtian religion ſhould ſeem inferiour in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward luſtre and pompe to heatheniſme, partly, that the Pagans by the likeneſſe of theſe rites with theirs, might bee the more eaſily drawen to Chriſtianity: And this verie thing was afterward pretended by the following Biſhops, as <hi>Gregories</hi> Epiſtle to <hi>Serenus</hi> teſtifies. Now this <hi>Silveſter</hi> was he, on whom Conſtantine (as Platina recordeth in the life of this Biſhop) impoſed an <hi>embroidered mitre</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet with Gold and Pearles in ſtead of a Diadem: And then this <hi>great ſtarre</hi> began to fall from heaven unto the earth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And upon the third part of the rivers</hi>] that is, as I underſtand, on the Romane Biſhops the ſucceſſours of this <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> and others: for <hi>rivers</hi> doe note the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of Churches, by whom divine doctrines ought to flow, and be derived unto others. Of theſe <hi>the third part,</hi> not all (for many remained faithfull and ſincere) but a great number, or the third part of them that lived in Europe, leaving heaven gave themſelves wholie to worldly cares, pleaſures, pompe, and fooliſh ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, defiling the Church with many abuſes, ſuperſtitions, errours, yea &amp; groſſe hereſies alſo. For as <hi>Ierom</hi> and the <hi>Eccleſiaſticall hiſtory</hi> both teſtifie, <hi>Liberius</hi> was indeed a <hi>great ſtarre</hi> (beeing at the firſt a great oppoſer of <hi>Constantius</hi>) but over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by baniſhment, at length, he yeelded to <hi>

                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſacius</hi> Arians, to the end he might by this apoſtaſie regaine the Romiſh chaire. His ſucceſſour <hi>Felix</hi> II. was a profeſſed Arian. Yea all the Biſhops of the Eaſt except <hi>Athanaſius</hi> and <hi>Paulinus</hi> (as the ſaid <hi>Ierom</hi> witneſſeth againſt the errours of <hi>John</hi>) were infected with the Arian peſt: Beſides how the following Romane Biſhops have behaved themſelves, may be ſeen by the hiſtories of <hi>Platina, Balaeus,</hi> and others, who have recorded their lives and Acts. By the <hi>Fountaines,</hi> I underſtand the holy ſcriptures, namely <hi>the living fountaines of Iſrael</hi> Pſal. 68.27. By the <hi>waters;</hi> the doctrines and comforts contained in them.

Hee alludes undoubtedly to the bitter waters of <hi>Marah,</hi> which the Iſraelites could not drinke <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.25. To <hi>this bitternes</hi> appertaine the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible confuſions of the Eaſtern and Weſtern Churches by the Arians: the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of Biſhops, the oppoſitions of Councils each to other, condemning, rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and perſecuting one the other, to the great ſcandall of the heathens, diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance and deſtruction of Chriſtian Churches: The which Emperours ſometimes occaſioned, otherwhile connived at, and ſometimes wanted power to ſuppreſſe the pride of Biſhops beeing lifted up with ambition and envie one againſt the other, they having before put to much power into their hands. Of which read the Eccleſiaſticall hiſtories of <hi>Socrates, Sozomenus, Theodoretus, Evagrius,</hi> &amp; <hi>Nicepho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>

                        <p>Howbeit wee are to take notice, that the Church was not deſtitute of comfort in theſe evill times: For not all the rivers, nor all the waters were made bitter, neyther were all men killed with <hi>Wormwood,</hi> but a <hi>third part</hi> onely: For Chriſt even in the midſt of all this <hi>bitternes</hi> and ruin of Biſhops, did ſtill preſerve a Church unto himſelf: And indeed hiſtories aboundantly teſtifie, that there were many faithfull, and ſound profeſſours of the faith of Chriſt, who reſiſted the pride and arrogancie of the Romiſh Biſhops: as for example the <hi>Councill of Carthage</hi> (of which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was preſident) openly reproved and ſuppreſſed the affected tyranny, of three Popes, (viz. <hi>Sozimus, Boniface,</hi> &amp; <hi>Caeleſtinus</hi>) over the Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Churches.</p>

Neither doth the praediction of Chriſt, agree with what is here ſaid touching the defect of the third part of the lights: Indeed there may bee ſome alluſion in this trumpet to the laſt ſignes: But without doubt other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents are noted by the ſame.</p>

                           <hi>Bullinger</hi> interprets this allegorie after the ſame manner, yet applies it not to the hereſie of <hi>Eutyches,</hi> but of <hi>Pelagius.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Franciſcus Lambertus</hi> expounds it in a generall way: <hi>Christ the Sunne ſhall be ſmitten, when the light of his truth ſhall be hid: then alſo the Moon the Church, and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:96676:107"/>ſtars the teachers ſhall faile:</hi> but he ſhewes not when and how this was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed.</p>
                        <p>For my part, howbeit the apparitions of this <hi>trumpet</hi> doe much agree with the events of the <hi>ſixt ſeale</hi> (for as here, ſo there the light of the <hi>Sunne, Moone,</hi> and <hi>Starres</hi> are ſaid to be darkened) yet I judge there is a manifeſt difference. For here onely <hi>the third part</hi> of lights is darkened: but there a total defect is ſpoken of: beſides, the Analogie of the <hi>ſeales</hi> and <hi>trumpets</hi> is to be kept unto what poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly we can.
<note place="margin">Whether the fourth trumpet doth agree with the ſixt ſeale.</note> Now there the total Apoſtaſie from the faith by the darkening of true doctrine under Antichriſt is denoted: but here the beginning and growth thereof onely: certain therfore it is, that the total obſcuration of the Sunne ſhalbe at the ſounding of the fift trumpet following.</p>
                        <p>So that I doe here again follow the <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Gloſſe,</hi> that the wonders of this <hi>fourth trumpet</hi> agree with that which happened at the opening of the <hi>fourth ſeale:</hi> As therefore we ſaw there a pale horſe, with death his rider, and hell following, by ſword famine and peſtilence devouring the fourth part of the earth; by which is ſignified (as we have ſhewed) the ſtate of the Church a little before the riſing of Antichriſt, beeing ſick with a mortall palenes, and neare unto death: accidently occaſioned by the overmuch liberallitie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgencie of Chriſtian Emperours, who thereby corrupted the Biſhops and Chriſtian religion: but <hi>principallie</hi> by ſuperſtitious Monkes and vaine glorious Biſhops, who little caring eyther for Chriſt or his graces, onely laboured how they might ſatisfy, and fill their own bellies, and eſtabliſh their Lordly authoritie, turning the doctrines of faith into humane Philoſophie, and Chriſtian religion into a ſtageplay and horrible idol worſhip.</p>
                        <p>So here againe the very ſame thing is foretold in this trumpet under different types. For as <hi>Anonymus,</hi> and after him <hi>Gagnaeus</hi> have obſerved, <hi>the Sunne</hi> ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows out the chiefe Prelates of the Church, as <hi>Popes, Cardinals, Arch-biſhops,</hi> &amp; <hi>Biſhops,</hi> who ought to ſhine before others by the light of their life and doctrine: <hi>The Moon,</hi> which receives its light from the Sunne, to be inferior Eccleſiaſtical orders, as curates and <hi>religious perſons: The Stars:</hi> beeing leſſe in light are the laitie: but I rather underſtand by <hi>Stars,</hi> Biſhops and other teachers ſo called as we have ſeen <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>Verie fitlie</hi> (ſaith Gagnaeus,) <hi>is the third part of the Sun ſayd to be ſmitten, in ſo much that the third part thereof was darkened: conſidering how one part of Praelates doe ſhine in life and doctrine: others but in one onely, and a part in neyther of both. For many of them neyther burn in charitie, nor ſhine in doctrine (and I would it were but a third part of them) but the truth is, they have onelie an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall ſhew of true paſtors: for after the likenes of this Sunne the third part of the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour</hi> Clergie and Laiks <hi>alſo, were ſmitten with obſcuritie and blindneſse, &amp;c.</hi> Thus he in a general way doth not with out good cauſe complaine of <hi>Popes, Cardinals,</hi> &amp; <hi>Biſhops</hi> their great Apoſtaſie. But wee are (as I have ſaid) to applie theſe things by an Analogie unto the events of <hi>the fourth ſeale.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This <hi>trumpet</hi> therefore appertaines unto the darkneſſe &amp; corruptions brought into the Chriſtian Churches during the ſpace of three hundred yeeres, viz. from <hi>Sylveſters</hi> time unto the riſing of Antichriſt: in which time all theſe things were allegorically fulfilled, as hiſtories teſtifie: Yet onely in <hi>a third part,</hi> that is, in <hi>Europe</hi> alone. And this againe ſerves for to mitigate the evils: in aſmuch as not the whole Sun but onely <hi>a third part</hi> thereof is ſmitten with darkeneſſe: For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed many Biſhops in the Eaſt and Weſt both Greeks and Latine did ſtill up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the light in the Church: For as yet Antichriſt was not lifted up into the chaire of <hi>univerſall peſtilence:</hi> neyther was the Church ſo neere unto death by a mortal palenes, although hell had allmoſt ſwallowed up the fourth part thereof. Thus we have heard four trumpets of the Angels, with the hiſtories thereof.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſeth that he dares not raſhly pronounce any thing concerning this dark propheſie: And yet in the mean while in a long oration, or rather a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrical invective, conſiſting almoſt of as many lies as words, he moſt raſhly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth <hi>Luther</hi> to bee this <hi>ſtarre: The ſmoake aſcending out of the pit,</hi> to be the doctrine of <hi>Luther:</hi> and that the innumerable multitude of theſe horrible <hi>Locuſis,</hi> doe moſt lively expreſſe his diſciples. But this whole fiction is ſo ridiculous, as indeed <hi>Alcaſar</hi> himſelf derides it, <hi>I wonder</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>that he did not alſo referre it to the fall of Judas.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But how ſhould <hi>Luther</hi> a poore and obſcure <hi>Auguſtine Monke</hi> bee this <hi>great ſtarre?</hi> he ſaith, <hi>though he were poore, yet hee became rich, though at first he profeſſed abſtinencie from marriage, yet afterward hee tooke a wife, &amp; of a Monke became a ſtates<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> I anſwer, by <hi>great falling ſtarres</hi> none can properly bee ſignified, but great and mighty praelates: and therefore I wonder why be upbraideth <hi>Luther</hi> with his riches, ſeeing he neyther had, nor left any behinde him: now although it be true, he was poore (but no worldlie politician, onely aprofeſſour of divinitie) yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he had many rich adverſaries, and among the number <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe was not the leaſt, who of a <hi>Monke</hi> became a mightie Politician, &amp; famous Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal. If <hi>Luther</hi> therefore <hi>fell from heaven,</hi> becauſe (according to the Apoſtles Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non) he was married: then <hi>Bellarmine</hi> may as well ſay, that the Apoſtle in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding <hi>a Biſhop to be the husband but of one wife,</hi> doth thereby throw down the ſtarres from heaven: But the very truth is, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> by this his wantonneſſe of wit indeavours to darken this viſion, that ſo he may preſerve the Popes reputation, as if by this <hi>falling ſtar</hi> he were not typed out, beſides he would diſſipate this hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:96676:110"/>ſmoake (if he could) from popery, leaſt hee himſelf ſhould be accounted (as in truth he is) a leading and chiefe locuſt among the reſt. Theſe things I thought good to rehearſe, that I may not ſeem to deſpiſe the opinions of other interpreters: and that the reader among the variety of expoſitors may take what he liketh beſt: and the rather, becauſe this propheſie is ſomewhat darke: notwithſtanding if all things bee well conſidered, it will eaſilie and undoubtedly appear, that by the fal of this <hi>great ſtarre</hi> nothing elſe is praefigured, but the apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of the Romiſh Biſhop, who makes himſelf head of the Church: together with his deviſed Hierarchie. I will therefore, (not out of any ſiniſter affection,) but truely as the things are, &amp; according as the Lord hath made me to ſee now come to expound everie particular, leaving it unto the judgement of the reader.</p>
                        <p>It is plaine, that by <hi>ſtarres,</hi> in the <hi>Revelation</hi> are noted, not Emperours or earthly kings, but Biſhops and teachers of Churches: by <hi>great ſtarres</hi> therefore are meant, not the inferiour miniſters or Biſhops (as they are called) but prelates of higher note and ranke. Now the reaſon of the analogie I have ſhewed on Chap. 1.20.
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.14.</note> to wit, becauſe Biſhops ought to ſhine like ſtarres in ſinceritie of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and holineſſe of life: they ought (I ſay) to bee the light of the world. And hence it is, that with the <hi>Catholick Gloſſe, Morelius, Alphonſus, Bullin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> and other learned interpreters, I underſtand this <hi>great ſtarre fallen from heaven,</hi> to ſignifie ſome chiefe and eminent Biſhop: By his <hi>fall from heaven</hi> into the earth, is ſignified his apoſtaſie from the heavenly truth, unto earthly doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of humane traditions. But who ſhould this bee?</p>
                        <p>In the <hi>third trumpet</hi> the <hi>great ſtar falling from heaven</hi> was the <hi>Biſhop of Rome,</hi> (who beeing accounted by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> as a God on earth, and enriched with wealth and power above meaſure) began to ſwell with great pride, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the ſucceſſours of <hi>Sylvester</hi> by meanes of the Emperours decree, began to <hi>fall upon the third part of the rivers and fountaines of waters,</hi> that is, leaving the ſtudie of heavenly things, affected an earthly dominion and power over the Churches and Biſhops of all Europe (which hitherto was the third part of the world) and by bringing in pernicious ſuperſtitions and worſhip of idols, made the waters bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to the deſtruction of the Eaſtern Churches.</p>
                        <p>Now this <hi>great ſtarr fallen from heaven</hi> is not another, but the verie ſame. For it is to be obſerved that <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith not as before, <gap reason="foreign">

Now here he ſees the adjuncts and effects of the ſame Star, beeing far more grievous then before. At firſt he ſaw it to fall upon the third part of the rivers and waters, making them bitter with <hi>wormewood,</hi> ſo as they became mortal to many: Yet was not the ſame a total corruption and Apoſtaſie. But now he ſees this ſtarre fully fallen, neither vaniſhed away, nor periſhed in the waters, but ſticking faſt like filth unto the earth, as doe ſlimy and thick vapours which fall from heaven.</p>
                        <p>He ſaw alſo <hi>the key of the bottomleſſe pit given unto him:</hi> to open therewithall <hi>the bottomleſſe pit,</hi> &amp;c. by which was repreſented unto Iohn a worſe ſhape, or condition of <hi>the Romiſh chaire,</hi>

By which it is plaine, that in this place the riſing of the great Romane Antichriſt is deſcribed: For to what other Eccleſiaſtical perſon (I pray you) can theſe things poſſibly be applied? And indeed <hi>Gregorie</hi> makes him to bee the Antichriſt, who ſhould affect the title of an <hi>univerſall priest:</hi> the which thing <hi>Boniface the third</hi> did three yeere after his deceaſe, beeing declared in the yeere 606. by <hi>Phocas</hi> the intruder <hi>univerſall Pope, chiefe Prieſt, and Biſhop of Biſhops.</hi> And therefore it muſt needs be that he was <hi>this ſtarre</hi> here ſaid to be <hi>fallen:</hi> Nevertheleſſe it may not be underſtood of <hi>Boniface</hi> alone, but of all his ſucceſſors in that ſea: even as before the <hi>great falling ſtar</hi> typed out not onely <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> but alſo his ſucceſſours untill <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie.</hi> It is true <hi>Boniface</hi> himſelf ſate ſcarſly one yeere on the chair of <hi>univerſall

                        <p>I am not ignorant that ſome learned men doe think that <hi>Mahumet</hi> is here to be underſtood,
<note place="margin">Mahumet cannot be here meant.</note> who about this time cauſed an open apoſtaſie from the faith of Chriſt in moſt of the Eaſtern parts, beeing eſteemed by his followers a great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and ſo is unto this day. But I ſee no reaſon, why in ſcripture he ſhould be called <hi>a coeleſtiall ſtar,</hi> ſeeing it is certaine that from the very firſt he was a moſt wicked deceiver, and a cruel murtherer, ſetting up his owne dreames by magical art, &amp; power of the ſword. Wherefore I judge that here is moſt plainely typed out <hi>the Romiſh Antichriſt</hi> with his clergie: but <hi>Mahumet</hi> in the following trumpet.</p>
                        <p>The ſum of all is this, that we may interpret the Revelation by it ſelfe, the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of this <hi>ſtarre,</hi> is that <hi>great earthquake,</hi> which aroſe at the opening of the <hi>ſixt ſeale,</hi> of which you may ſee, what we have obſerved on Chap. 6. v. 12.</p>

                           <hi>And to him was given the key of the bottomleſſe pit</hi>] The principall thing here ſhewed unto Iohn, is the giving of <hi>the key of the bottomleſſe pit</hi> unto this apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall ſtarre.

                        <p>
                           <hi>The bottomleſſe pit</hi>] This is not meant of the whole gulfe, but as it were the deepeſt and narroweſt receptacle &amp; filthie ſinck of hell.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The key of the bottomleſſe pit</hi>] That is, power to open and ſhut the ſame, thruſting into, and delivering out of it whomſoever he pleaſeth. For <hi>keyes</hi> doe ſignifie <hi>power.</hi> Now who beſides the Pope doth uſurpe this power unto himſelfe? which plainely ſhewes, that he is this <hi>apoſtaticall ſtarre.

And hence it is, that the Pope hath power both in heaven, and earth, and hell: in token whereof he weares on his head <hi>a triple crowne,</hi> &amp; thus hath writen in one of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees: <hi>if the Pope ſhould ſend many thouſands of men into hell, no man may ſay unto him, what doeſt thou?</hi> hence he impoſeth lawes on the conſciences, makes new articles of faith, canoniſeth bookes, ſaintes &amp; images, celebrates Iubilees, ſends forth innumerable indulgences or pardons for ſinne, emptieth purgatorie, the which latter may not unfittly be applyed to this <hi>bottomleſse pit.</hi> But in truth this key was given unto him by Satan that old ſerpent, according to that of the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, <hi>The comming of Antichriſt ſhallbe after the working of Satan, with all power, &amp;c.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>I confeſſe indeed that the firſt Biſhop or paſtor of the Chriſtian Church at Rome, received the key of the kingdom of heaven from Chriſt, that is, power to binde and looſe the conſciences of men according to the Law and Goſpell. But Satan contrarie hereunto gave unto the Pope this helliſh key: by which he hath
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:96676:111"/>thruſt aſide and made voyd <hi>Chriſts key.</hi> And hence it is that the Pope hath <hi>two keyes</hi> croſſwiſe in his enſignes.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheleſſe this came not to paſſe without Gods ſecret and unſearcheable judgement, as the Apoſtle witneſſeth 2 Theſſ. 2. ſaying, that the comming indeed of Antichriſt is with all deceiveableneſſe of unrighteouſneſſe: Yet <hi>God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſion, that they ſhould beleeve a ly, becauſe they received not the love of the truth:</hi> Now this we muſt not underſtand onelie of a bare permiſſion, as if God did nothing, but looke upon that which <hi>Satan, Phocas</hi> &amp; <hi>Antichrist</hi> ſhould doe: but hee willingly granted this power unto him by his ſecret and righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that ſo both hee himſelf, and all they might bee damned who beleeved not the truth. Thus it is ſaid alſo in v. 3. <hi>that power was given to the locusts to hurt men as the ſcorpions of the earth have power,</hi> that is, from their king the devill, yet ſo, as not without the ordering hand of God, who wiſely diſpoſeth all things, whither don by men or devils. And thus in Chap. 13. v. 5.7.15. it is ſaid, that <hi>it was given to the beaſt to make warre with the Saintes, &amp; to give life to the image of the beaſt,</hi> &amp;c. Whence we may ſee, how God righteouſly puniſheth ſinne with ſinne in Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts kingdome. And this thing we are to take notice of, that ſo in the midſt of theſe Antichriſtian confuſions we may not look upon Antichriſt and the devill onely, but indeed cheifely conſider and adore, the preſence and ſecret judgements of God.</p>

Chriſt hath it truely and by right of his Godhead and mediation, as beeing Lord of death and hell, &amp; that he may redeem ſinners out of the power thereof: but Antichriſt hath it falſelie and by deceit, as beeing <hi>king of locuſts,</hi> and impudently profeſſing himſelf to bee Chriſts vicar: Beſides he hath not the <hi>key of hell</hi> abſolutely, but of the bottomleſſe pit, or of the ſinke of hel, and thence to raiſe the ſmoak of his peſtilent lies &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, to the damnation of the inhabitants of the earth.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>And hee opened the bottomleſſe pit</hi>] Now <hi>John</hi> expoundeth the peſtilent effects of this power. The <hi>bottomleſſe pit</hi> was ſhut up by the doctrine of the Prophets and Apoſtles, who pluckt men out of the ſnares of Satan, by leading them unto the living fountaines of Iſrael: it was ſhut up, (I ſay,) almoſt untill theſe times; For hetherto the faithfull teachers took heed that this peſtilent ſmoake might not ſpread it ſelf over their Churches. But now Antichriſt having gotten the <hi>key</hi> into his hand, unlocked as it were the verie gate of hell which before was ſhut. But what is this? ſurely nothing elſe but the Popes <hi>univerſal power,</hi> by which he labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, not to open unto men the kingdome of God, but on the contrarie to unlooſe the verie barrs of hell, that ſo the world might ruſh headlong into the ſame. Now the Pope opened this bottomleſſe pit, when by his authority hee eſtabliſhed his filthy errours, ſuperſtitions, idols, &amp;c. and tooke out of the Church the certainty of faith &amp; perſeverance, tormenting &amp; infuſing into the conſciences of men feares, doubtings &amp;c. This was the porch or entrie into hell: he opened therefore the bottomleſſe pit, for the deſtruction of all men, like as hunters open caves &amp; pits, whereinto the unwarie deere might fall and be taken. This was the firſt effect of the key.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And there aroſe a ſmoak out of the pit</hi>] This ſecond effect, is an exhalation of a peſtilent ſmoake which neceſſarily followes the former, as when an houſe of office is uncovered there ariſeth a filthy ſtinke. And it is called <hi>a ſmoake,</hi> becauſe it aſcendeth out of hell, as ſmoake doth from fire. Moreover it is not a thinne, but a verie thick ſmoke, as of <hi>a great furnace,</hi> like to bakers, brickmakers, ſmiths, or the like.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>ſmoake</hi> is nothing els, but the blacke and ſmoaky divinity of the Pope: His wicked decrees touching images and idol worſhip, his taking upon him to purge ſins by maſſes, penance, ſatisfactions, pilgrimages, almes, purgatorie, jubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lees,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:96676:111"/>pardons &amp;c: the primacle of his Romiſh chaire, his power in heaven and hell: to be ſhort the whole volumes of their Canons &amp; Decretals, together with the inextricable toyes of Scholaſtick divinity, by all which the Pope hath in very deed brought a thick <hi>ſmoake</hi> upon the Chriſtian world, eſtabliſhing a mingle man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle of Iudaiſme &amp; Paganiſme, in ſtead of Chriſtianity, &amp; oppreſſing the truth of Chriſt with moſt groſſe darkneſſe. Now the doctrines of Antichriſt are compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſmoake from the effects thereof. For as the ſmoake obſcures the ayre, hurts the eyes, cauſeth ſuch a darkneſſe, that things cannot bee ſeen as they are, and he which walketh in it, is in danger to be ſtiffled, or to fall down headlong: even ſo is it with Antichriſts ſmoake: therefore it followeth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And the Sun and the aire was darkned</hi>] The Revelation expounds it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>fourth trumpet</hi> ſounding, the third part of the Sun, Moon and Stars was ſmitten. But here the whole Sun is darkened, and ſo conſequently the aire which is enlightned by the ſame. This ſignifies the ſame evil, with the former, but more grievous: For before onely a third part, but here a totall defect of the light appeareth. Nothing is more ſad to behold then totall eclipſes. (as happened in Aegypt at Chriſts paſſion) For all things then are in darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the day beeing turned into the night.</p>
                        <p>Now as Chriſt is the Sun of righteouſneſſe: ſo nothing can be ſignified by this total darkneſſe, but that <hi>univerſall Apoſtaſie from the faith,</hi> which the Apoſtle foretold ſhould come to paſſe under Antichriſt. Vntill the times of <hi>Gregorie</hi> the <hi>third part</hi> of the Sun was ſmitten, that is, much darkeneſſe was brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church by Biſhops, hereticks, hypocrites, hermites and monkes, as we have before ſhewed upon the going forth of <hi>the black and pale horſe,</hi> as alſo at the ſounding of the <hi>the third and fourth trumpet.</hi> But after <hi>Gregorie, Boniface</hi> at length, and his ſucceſſours ſitting on the chaire of VNIVERSAL peſtilence, a horrible night darkened <hi>Chriſt the Sun</hi> in the Church, for all places were filled with moſt groſſe darkneſſe of Popiſh decrees, traditions, ſuperſtitions, ceremonies, lies, fraud and Sophiſtrie. The ſumme of all is this: The darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Sun which the <hi>Apoſtaticall Star</hi> brought in by his helliſh ſmoake of <hi>Popiſh divinity,</hi> doth exactly anſwer to that obſcurity which happened at the opening of <hi>the ſixt ſeal.</hi> For the Sun was <hi>made black like ſackcloth of haire,</hi> the Moon was turned into blood, the Stars fell from heaven unto the earth &amp;c. by al which (as we there ſhewed) is myſtically ſet forth that horrible night of blindneſſe, which Chriſt ſuffered during Antichriſts reigne.</p>
                        <p>But thou wilt ſay how can this darkeneſſe bee applied unto the Papacy, ſeeing they profeſſe the name of Chriſt, beleeve him to be the ſaviour, receive the Apoſtolicall faith, and to be ſhort, acknowledge the holy Scriptures of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this day?</p>
                        <p>Now here I deſire the reader to conſider what I have before anſwered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this faire pretence: And what the Apoſtle ſaid unto the hypocritical tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of his time (who under a ſhew of preaching Chriſt, brought into the Church Iewiſh ceremonies, and a flagitious licentiouſneſſe of life) <hi>they profeſſe that they know God, but in workes they denie him:</hi> The which how fitlie it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth to Antichriſt the fathers of old, as <hi>Hilarie, Auſtin</hi> and others, have wel obſerved. It is true indeed, in word hee profeſſeth Chriſt, but in workes he denies him: For had he come as an open enemie of Chriſt, he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have invaded the kingdome of the Church: but his comming was (as the Apoſtle hath foretold) <hi>with all deceiveableneſſe of unrighteouſneſſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus we ſee that Antichriſt under the name of Chriſt ſhould oppoſe Chriſt, and labour to deſtroy the faith of Chriſt out of the harts of men. <hi>The proprietie of Antichriſts name</hi> (ſaith HILARIE) <hi>is, to be contrarie to Chriſt: the which is now effected under the opinion of fained pietie: This is now preached under ſhew of preaching the Goſpell, And indeed Chriſt, while hee ſeems to be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, is denyed.</hi> So AVSTIN: <hi>Hee alſo is to bee eſteemed the</hi> SON OF PERDITION
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:96676:112"/>
                           <hi>who under the</hi> NAME OF CHRIST <hi>which is the name of God, that is, making ſhew of beeing a Chriſtian, extolles himſelf above Christ:</hi> whence it appeareth that theſe fathers were of opinion, that Antichriſt under the name of Chriſt &amp; the faith of Chriſt, ſhould deny both.</p>
                        <p>But how is this don by the Papiſts? This hath fully been, manifeſted long agoe.</p>
                        <p>They pray unto the images of Marie made of ſtone, wood, gold, &amp;c. <hi>Holy Marie, queene of heaven heare us, ſave us, O thou our onely hope, &amp;c. In thee O Ladie I trust. Into thy hands O Ladie I commend my ſpirit. The Lord ſaid unto my Ladie, ſit thou at my right-hand, &amp;c.</hi> And unto other images thus: <hi>S. Peter, S. Paul, S. Nicolas, S. Magdalene have mercie on us, ſave us, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Is not this in workes to deny God, and Chriſt the onely Saviour; albeit in the words of the <hi>Creed</hi> they doe profeſſe him? They teach that the remiſſion of ſins, righteouſneſſe and eternal life is to be ſought for in the merits of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane workes, as penance, ſatisfactions, Iubilees, indulgences, maſſes, exorciſmes, proceſſions, pilgrimages, purgatorie, &amp;c. Is not this (whatſoever they profeſſe) a denying of the blood and merit of Ieſus Chriſt?</p>
                        <p>The Pope boaſteth to be the <hi>Vicar of Christ,</hi> the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Monarch</hi> of the Church on earth: But Chriſt neyther appointed nor gave any ſuch office unto the Church. Read 1 Cor. 12.8. and Epheſ. 4.11. where the diſtinct orders and office which Chriſt gave unto the bodie, are all reckoned up. Now if any man takes upon him to bee a Kings Vicar, without his appointment; is not ſuch a one the kings enemie?

He hath made himſelf to bee the GREATEST high-prieſt of the Church, whereas Chriſt is called the GREAT High-prieſt thereof. Heb. 4. &amp; 12. By how much therefore <hi>greatest</hi> is more then <hi>great,</hi> by ſo much the Pope hath lift himſelf up above Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>To be ſhort,</hi> he not onely weakens, but labours wholy to take away all faith out of the harts of the Godly, not onely in making the ſcriptures (which is <hi>the rule of faith</hi>) to depend on his will: but alſo in denying and comdemning all certainty and confidence of grace, mercie, and ſalvation: and on the contrarie he will have the conſcience to be in perpetuall trouble, fear and doubtings. I forbear to ſpeake more: theſe things are ſufficient to ſhew how in the Papacie, <hi>the Sun was darkened by the ſmoake of hell.</hi>

                           <hi>And the aire by reaſon of the ſmoake of the pit.</hi>] The Sun being darkned the aire of neceſſitie muſt be ſo likewiſe:
<note place="margin">What is meant by the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the aire.</note> For the aire (darke in it ſelf) is enlightned by the Sun. <hi>Lyra</hi> well underſtands by <hi>the aire</hi> the Church; becauſe the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives her light from Chriſt, as doth <hi>the aire</hi> from <hi>the Sun.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now the Church vaniſhed out of the ſight of men, when ſhe lay hid and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried (as it were) under the <hi>ſmoke</hi> of this pit, beeing changed into the chaire and kingdom of Antichriſt. At firſt the ſtate of the Church was oeconomicall, wherein Chriſt as the onely father of his houſhold taking a far journy even to heaven, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed many ſervants over his familie, the Church, and howſoever he gave unto them diverſitie of talents or gifts, yet equall power in the diſpenſation thereof. But Antichriſt having poſſeſſed the chaire of VNIVERSAL peſtilence, altered this <hi>oeconomicall</hi> ſtate into a Monarchie, and was acknowledged (in ſtead of Chriſt) to be the prieſt and head of the Church. But thou wilt ſay was Chriſt now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Church, had he quite forſaken and loſt his ſpouſe? Theſe indeed are the objections of the Romiſh Paraſites, but they are idle and frivolous: For in the midſt of the confuſions of Antichriſt, Chriſt (as we heard before) preſerved unto himſelf out of <hi>everie tribe and nation, &amp; tongue</hi> 144000 <hi>ſealed ones:</hi> So that there was a Church even in the bowels of Popery, although it were not in the leaſt the <hi>Papall Hierarchie,</hi> which caried the title thereof.</p>
                        <p>We may alſo interpret <hi>the aire</hi> to be the holy Scriptures, or the miniſtry of the Church: for as the aire inſtrumentally brings the light of the Sun unto us: ſo by the holy Scriptures and the opening of them, the light of the glorious Goſpell of Chriſt doth brightly ſhine in our harts. But now this <hi>aire</hi> was darkened, viz. by a fatal everſion of the word, and the whole eccleſiaſtical order. But I rather ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the former ſence. For touching, the eccleſiaſticall order, how it began, the hiſtorie of the locuſts will ſhew.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>And there came out of the ſmoake Locusts</hi>] We have heard three effects of this <hi>Apoſtaticall Star,</hi> viz. the opening of the bottomleſſe pit, the ſmoake of the pit, &amp; the darkening of the ſun and aire. Now the fourth followes, a monſtrous brood of <hi>Locusts</hi> came out of the ſmoake of the pit.</p>

                        <p>I therefore (leaving all theſe,) doe in this aſcent unto the <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Gloſſe,</hi> to the <hi>Gloſſe</hi> alſo of <hi>Illyricus</hi> and <hi>Bullinger,</hi> who following <hi>Bede</hi> and <hi>Anonymus,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by theſe Locuſts the diſciples of Antichriſt,
<note place="margin">The appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Locuſts to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated.</note> that is, the innumerable troope of the Popiſh clergie, neyther is there any weight in what is objected to the contrarie.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> they ſay, that Antichriſts kingdom is deſcribed hereafter in <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. Now howſoever this be true, yet is it not a ſufficient ground to prove the thing they bring it for: For as it is both there and here deſcribed, ſo alſo (as we have ſhewed) it was before prefigured in the <hi>ſecond viſion</hi> at the opening of <hi>the ſixt ſeale:</hi> yea it ſhallbe alſo againe deſcribed in the <hi>fift</hi> &amp; <hi>ſixt viſions.</hi> For in every one of theſe prophetical viſions the ſame is repeated, and more clearly illuſtrated.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly</hi> they object, that theſe <hi>Locuſts</hi> ſhall onely rage for the ſpace of <hi>five monthes:</hi> whereas the power of the <hi>Romiſh clergie</hi> hath already continued much longer: <hi>But</hi> neyther is this to the purpoſe: For the time of <hi>five monthes</hi> is not here preciſely to be underſtood according to the letter, (for in this ſence it would as little agree with the <hi>Vandals</hi> and hereticks, whoſe time of rage &amp; cruelty laſted many yeeres:) But the words allude to that ſpace of time, in which the Locuſts are in their chiefe vigour &amp; ſtrength, as we ſhall heare hereafter.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly</hi> they object: that the <hi>power</hi> given to the <hi>Locuſts</hi> is not over the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, but them that were not ſealed. Wheras Antichriſt hath power over the <hi>ſealed ones,</hi> for he ſhall kill <hi>the witneſſes</hi> of the truth. <hi>But</hi> it is one thing to kill, and another thing to hurt. He ſhall indeed kill the <hi>two witneſſes,</hi> yet not hurt
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:96676:113"/>them, for <hi>the ſpirit of life from God ſhall enter into them</hi> Chap. 11. verſ. 11. therefore properly he onely ſhall hurt them that are not ſealed, by ſeducing and leading them to deſtruction, 2 Theſſ. 2.10.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Laſtly</hi> they object, that the <hi>Locuſts</hi> had power grievouſly to torment men, the which (ſay they) cannot be truly ſaid of them in the Papacy, who have lived in all kinde of carnal licenciouſneſſe. But we are to diſtinguiſh betwixt the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward condition of the fleſh, and the inward ſtate of the conſcience. Outwardly indeed idolaters rejoyce greatly, &amp; abound in all pleaſures: But inwardly when conſcience comes to worke, they feel ſecret torments: becauſe ſeeking life and ſalvation out of Chriſt, they never finde any reſt for their ſoules, but are torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with perpetuall anguiſh, feare and torture of hell or purgatorie, of which more hereafter.</p>
                        <p>Notwithſtanding therefore all the foreſaid objections, we underſtand by the <hi>Locuſts</hi> the <hi>Romiſh clergie,</hi> unto whom the whole deſcription &amp; all the effects ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of doe fitly agree.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. The <hi>Locuſts</hi> remaine skipping on the ground, and fly not up into the aire:
<note place="margin">Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Locuſts to the Romish clergie.</note> So this wicked clergie ſavours nothing but earthly things: ſeekes only after them, and not the things that are above.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. The <hi>Locuſts</hi> goe forth in great troopes: ſo in the Papacy there are ſeen innumerable ſwarmes of religions orders: in ſo much that one of their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals (as Sabellicus recordeth) promiſed ſometime unto the Pope, to ſend a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate armie of thirtie thouſand ſouldiers, conſiſting onely of Franciſcane Friers, to warre againſt the Turks, without any interruption of <hi>divine ſervice</hi> unto their cloiſters.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. The Locuſts ſing, and skippe in ſummer, and delight in eaſe. What doth this ſinfull clergie: But perpetually ſing, dance, and delight in pride and luxuriouſneſſe, beeing in the meane time ſerviceable neither to God or men.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. The Locuſts though but litle yet are <hi>gorbellied creatures,</hi> &amp; fall upon, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume and deſtroy moſt pleaſant feilds &amp; gardens. The falſe Romiſh clergie loves to bee in the greateſt and chiefeſt cities, poſſeſſe the pleaſanteſt vallies, inſinuate themſelves into great mens favour &amp; families, ſpoile &amp; devoure widowes howſes, build their cloiſters, colleges and palaces in places moſt commodious, gather infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite riches without labour, &amp;c. But let us ſee in order the riſing of theſe Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts, their power, age, figure and politie, al which is here ſet down by Iohn.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And there came out of the ſmoake</hi>] The riſing of the <hi>Locuſts</hi> is out of the pit.
<note place="margin">The origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of the Locuſts is out of the ſmoake of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe pit.</note> Signifying their greater and leſſer orders, their ſeverall religions and innumerable families of <hi>Franciſcanes, Dominicanes, Benedictines, Ciſtercians, begging and barefoot friers, whippers, Capuzins, Jeſuites &amp;c.</hi> all which ſpringing out of the ſmoake of humane traditions have through the authoritie of the <hi>Apoſtated Starre</hi> ſpread themſelves over the Chriſtian world: And indeed the inventions of merits, ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions, penance, maſſes, pardons, purgatorie &amp;c. were the roote of theſe innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable ſects and orders. He that will, may read a whole volume in <hi>Hospinian touching the originall of Monkes,</hi> and ſo doing he ſhall not need any other commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie to unfold the wonderfull birth of theſe <hi>graſſewormes,</hi> ſpringing out of the vaine inventions of Popiſh darkneſſe, as out of the ſmoake of the bottomleſſe pit.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And power was given unto them</hi>] Now he deſcribes their office and power.
<note place="margin">Their power.</note> The <hi>Locuſt</hi> is a little and weake creature: beeing able to bite and gnaw nothing ſave herbs, and the flowers of trees. But theſe <hi>Locuſts</hi> have a mightie &amp; deadly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>like unto the ſcorpions of the earth,</hi> that is, who hide themſelves in the earth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſtones, hils, and clifts of wals, to hurt them that paſſe by, by which is noted their moſt dangerous power, altogether venemous, ſecret and full of wiles, in ſo much as it can hardly be avoyded. For the <hi>ſcorpion</hi> is a little worme, faire and no way terrible to the ſight: but ſtriketh deadly with his taile, infuſing his mortall poyſon into the wound. So theſe <hi>ſpirituall flyes</hi> appeare to be weake without
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:96676:114"/>ſword or weapon, in their behaviour &amp; habit reverend, inſinuating themſelves by flattering ſpeeches into the mindes of men: But they infuſe the venome of their peſtilent doctrine into the harts of the ſimpler ſort: And as the ſcorpions ſting is not felt at firſt, but the venome workes by little and little untill it penetrate into the vitals of the hart: ſo at firſt the bitings of theſe grasſhoppers are not felt, but rather their pious deceits, are verie pleaſing unto men. But at length the deadly poyſon comes forth, cauſing their miſerable conſciences to ruſh head long into the ſorrowes of death, and gulte of utter deſperation.</p>
                        <p>But whence have theſe <hi>Locusts</hi> this great power? <hi>It is given them:</hi> by whom? <hi>First</hi> from their king <hi>Abaddon,</hi> or Antichriſt the Apoſtated ſtarre, by whoſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſo many orders were authoriſed and canonized. <hi>Secondly</hi> from Satan, by whoſe effectuall working the <hi>Son of perdition</hi> came to ſit <hi>in the temple of God. Laſtly</hi> from God, without whoſe moſt righteous permiſſion, neyther Satan, nor <hi>Abaddon</hi> could have effected any thing. So that the <hi>Locuſts</hi> have their venemous power from God alſo, yet in wrath. For it ſeemed him good in his righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the <hi>Locuſts</hi> to puniſh the horrible blindneſſe and idolatrie of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world:
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.10.</note> as the ſame Apoſtle witneſſeth: <hi>therefore God ſent them ſtrong delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. <hi>And it was commanded them that they ſhould not hurt</hi>] The limitation of their power is here added, and it is threefold, as we noted in the <hi>Analyſis.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> they are not permitted to hurt everie one, according to their owne, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans and Antichriſts luſt: but ſome onely: in which againe we obſerve three things.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> it is expreſly ſaid, that it was <hi>commanded them.</hi> But by whom? by Satan, or Abaddon? no verely; for it is their deſire to bring all unto deſtruction. But by God, who by his ſecret providence reſtraineth the tyrannie of Satan &amp; Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, that they cannot rage promiſcuouſly over all. This is the firſt conſolation of the godly, that the tyranny of Antichriſt is limited by the power of God.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> ſuch whom he may not hurt, are here noted. viz: <hi>Not the graſſe of the earth,
<note place="margin">Theſe Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts are no herb de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers.</note> nor any green thing, nor any tree.</hi> Now theſe ordinarily are the ſweeteſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures of the Locuſts. But God permits them not to touch theſe. By which we may underſtand, that theſe <hi>Locuſts</hi> are no <hi>graſſe eaters,</hi> or <hi>herb devourers:</hi> for <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts clergie</hi> feeds not on <hi>hay:</hi> the which alſo ſhews, that the graſſe &amp; trees here mentioned are not literally to be taken, but by alluſion to the paſture of the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts. The <hi>Graſſe of the earth</hi> notes (as alſo Chap. 8.7.) the generalitie of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, which ſhall as yet bee under Antichriſt. <hi>Green things,</hi> that is, ſuch Chriſtians as are in civill authoritie (for the greene wood is ſtrong) namely ſuch Princes,
<note place="margin">What is meant by Graſſe, green things, &amp; trees.</note> Kings, and Emperours, as have manfully oppoſed Antichriſts deceits. <hi>Trees,</hi> ſuch godly paſtors and teachers as in Antichriſts kingdome were eminent in piety &amp; zeale of pure doctrine, &amp; contradicted his wicked devices. Theſe the <hi>Locuſts</hi> are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid to hurt, that is, to ſeduce and deſtroy them. But thou wilt ſay, theſe as he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks they chiefly perſecute, hurt and kill. Chap. 11. It is ſo indeed, but by kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling they hurt them not, becauſe they can no way hinder their ſalvation. This is a ſecond conſolation, that the elect ſhall be freed from the biting of the <hi>Locuſts,</hi> by the providence of God: For it is impoſſible they ſhould bee ſeduced: <hi>None can pluke Chriſts ſheep out of his hand.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Hence it evidently appeares that the Lord hath preſerved in the greateſt dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Poperie, <hi>Graſſe, Green things,</hi> &amp; <hi>Trees,</hi> that is, ſome thouſands of Saintes, whoſe ſalvation the <hi>Locuſts</hi> could not hurt. The Sophiſters of our dayes ask where the Church was before <hi>Luther,</hi> If the Papacie was not? Now here we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that it was in the Papacie, but not the Papacie, becauſe ſome continually were ſaved, who held the foundation, and were not mortally wounded by the ſcorpions.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But onely thoſe men] Thirdly,</hi> theſe whome the <hi>Locuſts</hi> might and ſhould hurt are here ſpecified: <hi>men which have not the ſeale of God.</hi> By which we are not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:96676:114"/>as if the <hi>Graſſe, Green things, and Trees</hi> were not men alſo, but onely that they are not of the number of thoſe men, that ſhould be hurt. For in Chap. 7. <hi>Men</hi> are divided into <hi>ſealed ones,</hi> and <hi>not ſealed.</hi> The <hi>ſealed,</hi> are the faithfull or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect: Theſe are green graſſe, &amp; trees: the which the <hi>Locusts</hi> are prohibited to hurt. The <hi>not ſealed,</hi> are the reprobate: among whom is Antichriſt himſelf, as alſo theſe <hi>Locusts,</hi> who are commanded to hurt them which are not ſealed: not as if they themſelves were not alſo men unſealed, but becauſe here they repreſent not men, but Satans inſtruments.</p>
                        <p>Thus then we ſee that the <hi>Locuſts</hi> have power given them onely to hurt ſuch as have not <hi>the ſeale of God in their foreheads,</hi> (of which ſee Chap. 7.2.) as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle foretold 2 Theſſ. 2.9. that Antichriſts comming ſhould bee <hi>after the working of Satan with all power &amp; ſignes, &amp; lying wonders, in them that peeriſh,
<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>The</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.9.10. <hi>explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
                              </note> that they ſhould beleeve a ly, becauſe they received not the love of the truth, that they might be ſaved.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>By which words the Apoſtle gives us to underſtand: <hi>Firſt,</hi> that Antichriſt ſhall eſtabliſh his power by cunning and diabolicall deceit. <hi>Secondly,</hi> by his ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny he ſhall oppreſſe the greater part of men in the Chriſtian world: as not beeing ſealed. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that Antichriſts followers ſhall inevitably periſh &amp; run into deſtruction. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> that their deſtruction ſhall be voluntarie and juſt, becauſe they caſt off, or receive not the love of the truth, rather delighting in Popiſh dreames and Lyes. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> that under Antichriſt there ſhall be alwayes ſome ſound teachers of the truth, who ſhall ſuffer grievous contradiction: as in Chap. 11.4.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. <hi>And it was given them that they ſhould not kill</hi>] The firſt limitation of the <hi>Locuſts power,</hi> we have heard: here is added a SECOND, <hi>that they ſhould not kill men but torment them:</hi> alſo a <hi>third</hi> limitation, not allwayes, but <hi>for five monthes.</hi> Behold the wonderfull lenitie of God even in ſuffering the wicked, limiting and moderating their plagues, who deſerve to be deſtroyed all at one inſtant. The elect under Antichriſts kingdom he altogether preſerves from the mortall biting of theſe ſcorpions, inſomuch as wee doubt not, but that there are ſtill ſome god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly groaning under his tyrannie in the heart of Popery, as in <hi>Rome, Italie, Spaine,</hi> &amp;c. The other idolatrous troop he will not ſuffer the Locuſts ſuddenly to kill: to the end they may have time to repent: But onely to torment them: that thereby they might be ſtirred up to ſeek remedie for their ſowles.</p>
                        <p>Notwithſtanding it ſeems that not ſo much a mitigation, as an exaſperation is ſignified by the foreſaid limitation:
<note place="margin">This tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment notes the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Locuſts.</note> For it is far worſe to bee tormented with a lingring diſeaſe, then ſuddenly to periſh: neyther may we doubt, but that by this kinde of hurting is deſigned not a civill but an Eccleſiaſtical kinde of Locuſts: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſhall not kill mens bodies, as did the <hi>Vandales, Gothes,</hi> and other open tyrants: but they ſhall torment mens ſoules and conſciences, torturing them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually as on a rack by their deceitfull doctrines of penance, ſatisfactions, purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, &amp;c. Now what, (I pray) can be ſpoken more openly againſt the impoſtures of that <hi>falſe and Antichriſtian clergie?</hi> by which indeed for the preſent they kill not the bodie, but torment the wretched conſcience by ſhewing them remiſſion and explation of ſin, not in the faith of the Goſpell, in the mercies of God, and in the blood of Chriſt, but in the merits of good workes, auricular confeſſions, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring of ſins, impoſed penance, poenal ſatisfactions, going in pilgrimage to the ſepulchre of our Lord, S. Iames, the ladie of Lauretta, in travels by ſea and land, in faſting and abſtinence, in maſſes, in almes, and legaſies, building of Cloſters, in Moncks coules, in whippings, in going barefoot, &amp; laſtlie in the Popes jubilees, &amp; indulgences bought for mony. Now what are all theſe things, but the ſinful deviſes of men, altogether tending to the wounding of mens conſciences, and no way ſerving for the healing and helping of the ſame.

                        </p>
                        <p>This is the miſerable rack of the conſcience, none greater then it, nor more dangerous: Let the hiſtorie of the Romiſh Church and Emperours be read, and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:96676:115"/>there it will appeare that many through the furie and rage of the Locuſts, have been ſo ſtirred up, and brought to ſuch madneſſe, as to quiet their conſciences, they have of their own accord layd down the government of the Empire and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, put themſelves into religious Covents or monaſteries, built Cloiſters and Colledges for Monks with great liberallity, thereby to redeeme ſoules, have taken upon themſelves religious orders for the expiation of ſins, have woren either dead or living the cowles or hoodes of begging Fryars: but in all theſe things, what could they find, or hereby receive, but a perpetual torture &amp; trouble of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, a dreafull feare &amp; doubt of beeing deceived. We need not therefore ſeek theſe <hi>Locusts</hi> among the <hi>Vandales, Gothes, Hunnes, Saracens, Mahumetans,</hi> &amp;c. For theſe did promiſcuouſly rage and tyranniſe by fire &amp; ſword againſt the perſons both of the juſt &amp; unjuſt. Beſides it is verie cleare by the matter it ſelfe, that Eccleſiaſtical &amp; religious deceivers are here meant: who torment indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually the fearfull conſciences of men with the terrours of hell &amp; purgatorie: but ſend them not for releife to Chriſt by faith, but to the Popes lawes, that is, in ſtead of Phiſick adminiſter poyſon, and precipitate their ſoules into the gulfe of finall deſperation.</p>
                        <p>Moreover we are againe to take notice of the word <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>it was given,</hi> which I find to be twenty times repeated in this booke about Antichriſts tyranny, that ſo we may underſtand, that he doth not thus rage by chance, but as beeing Gods ſcourge to puniſh the ingratitude of the Chriſtian world: as alſo that he is bound &amp; limited by God, and cannot goe bejond the ſame. The which ſerves for our great comfort.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Five monthes</hi>] This is the third limitation of their power, ſerving alſo for our ſingular conſolation: Seeing God hath prefixed a certaine time to theſe <hi>Locusts,</hi> bejond which they ſhall not longer rage &amp; torment. Interpreters diſcourſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly about theſe <hi>five monthes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Some take it properly for five <hi>Aegyptian monthes,</hi> or an hundred &amp; fifty dayes, the time that the waters of the flood increaſed upon the face of the earth: ſome take it for ſo many yeares. Notwithſtanding they are much troubled how ſo ſhort a time ſhould agree to the tyranny either of the <hi>Vandales, Saracens,</hi> or <hi>Popiſh clergie. Bullingers</hi> expoſition beſt agrees with the nature of the place, viz. that the mitigation is taken from the age of <hi>Locusts,</hi> which ordinarily is no more then <hi>five monthes,</hi> making the ſenſe to be thus: that as the <hi>Locusts</hi> continew not hurting the whole yeere thorow, but ſing, leap, and feed upon the graſſe ſcarſly during the five ſummer monthes, that is, from <hi>April</hi> unto <hi>September:</hi> even ſo a certaine time is defined to Antichriſts ſeducers, after which they ſhall torment men no more. But this ſeems not to agree with hiſtories: For the Pope hath now for a thouſand yeeres &amp; more ſent forth his <hi>Locusts</hi> to ſpoile the field of the Church: neyther doth the end as yet appeare: Yea he ſhall continue devouring untill he bee conſumed by the <hi>brightneſſe of Christs comming.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But this no way contradicts what we have before ſaid, for what are <hi>five monthes</hi> with the Lord, ſeeing with him a thouſand yeeres are as one day? The time therefore of the <hi>Locusts</hi> is hereby deſigned, not as if it ſhould, be no longer then an hundred and fifty dayes, or yeeres, but becauſe it ſhould be ſhort: a definite time, being put for an indefinite: And thus alſo <hi>Alcaſar</hi> expounds it indefinitely, although (contrarie to the ſcope) he applie it to the plagues and converſion of the Iewes. But we are taught, however Antichriſt ſhall remaine with his <hi>Locusts,</hi> yet when he ſhalbe revealed, his tyranny &amp; the power of the Locuſts ſhalbe ſo weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that they ſhall not torment men any more, or at leaſt not ſo much as before they did: The truth whereof we ſee through Gods mercie theſe hundred yeeres accompliſhed, both in Germanie &amp; other kingdomes. For now the biting of theſe <hi>Locuſts</hi> is not ſo forcible, but everie where that ancient power of thoſe ſcorpions lies under contempt, becauſe the <hi>five monthes</hi> are ended. And as <hi>Polydore Virgil</hi> writes &amp; perſwades in his ſeventh booke Chap. 3. <hi>It would bee very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:96676:115"/>that theſe dregs of men, as ſuperfluous members of Christian religion, were cut off &amp; utterly conſumed, that ſo they might no longer with their filthineſſe ſtaine the puritie of Gods worſhip.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>And their torment</hi>] He amplifies their torments from a ſimilitude before ſpoken of ver. 3. for as the power of <hi>Scorpions</hi> was given to the <hi>Locusts:</hi> ſo their biting and torment is like unto that of <hi>Scorpions.</hi> The paine at the beginning is indeed not great, but ſuddenly ſo increaſeth, that if remedie be not had, it will kill the perſon wounded, within four and twenty houres: even ſo howſoever at firſt men little regard the biting of theſe <hi>Locusts,</hi> but give way to carnall reaſon and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſſe: yet at the houre of death all things appeare horrible and mortal.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. <hi>And in theſe dayes men ſhall ſeek death</hi>] Another amplification of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment taken from the moſt lamentable effect thereof, by which mens lives are not onely made bitter, but ſo deteſtable, as that they ſhall preferre death (of which all men ſtand in feare) before life: they ſhall, I ſay, deſire to change life for death, and good for evill. Now this is not the property of men ſober, but mad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting how this biting ſhall infatuate and beſott people, no otherwiſe then as it or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily happens to ſuch as are bitten by mad dogs: Even ſo theſe <hi>little beaſts</hi> with their ſtings have befooled the greateſt kings, and wiſe men of the earth, as that they have ſuffered themſelves to be dwawen, lead, ſet on work, and ſent wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they would, yea to be perſwaded, that black was white, that life eternal was comprehended under the hood of Monkes, that <hi>holie water</hi> purgeth ſin, &amp; quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the flames of purgatorie; that ſo at leaſt they might find ſome eaſe for their conſciences, the which notwithſtanding they obtained not. It is well knowen, that ſuch was the <hi>Germanes</hi> devotion to the Papacy, and in their devotion ſuch madneſſe, and in their madneſſe ſuch brutiſh obedience, as that they would doe any thing how abſurd ſoever (ſo it were impoſed by the <hi>Locusts</hi> in the Popes name) for to redeem ſoules out of hell and purgatorie: Inſomuch that the <hi>Cardinal</hi> CAIETAN ſaid (as it is reported) that if <hi>Luther had not been, the Germanes at the Popes beck, would have eaten (like oxen) hay for their provender.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And ſhall not finde it, but death ſhall flee from them</hi>] A further increaſe of ſorrow: they ſhall not finde remedie for their torments, no not in death. For there is no man but would rather once ſuffer death, then to be tormented with perpetual fear and expectation eyther of purgatorie, or the flames of hell fire. Then ſhall that ſaying be in force.</p>

With the like cruelty theſe Locuſts, beeing fatted and pampered in their cloiſters, &amp; ſtrengthened with the power of <hi>Abaddon</hi> their rider, they furiouſly oppoſe the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt, ſome by railing in their Pulpits, by diſputations, paſquils &amp;c. Others by cruel counſels &amp; bloody deſignes, as the hiſtories of Emperours, but chiefly of the <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Fredericks,</hi> &amp; <hi>Othoes</hi> have teſtified long agoe: namely, that they more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſtables then temples, &amp; better know how to handle bridles then bookes, more fitted &amp; prepared to occaſion, and wage warre to the deſtruction of the Chriſtian common wealth, then to performe holy duties.

                        <p>The King of <hi>the Locuſts</hi> weares on his head a triple crowne of moſt fine and bright gold, as governour both of heaven, earth and hell.</p>

                        <p>The <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and <hi>Abbats</hi> alſo have precious ornaments wrought with gold and ſilk: ſo that we need not much ſcruple what is meant by theſe crownes.</p>

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:96676:116"/>ſeparating themſelves from men: however they retaine humane faces, leaſt men ſhould abhorre and avoyd them. This ſignifies the fained humanity of theſe <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Locuſts:</hi> none ſeems more affable then they: They know how to flatter the <hi>Pope himſelfe,</hi> Kings, Princes, Courtiers, &amp;c. inſinuating themſelves bejond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyre into the favour of all both men &amp; woemen, beeing very acceptable to the world, &amp; eſteemed as peaceable, wiſe, ſober and godly perſons: whereas indeed they are carnal, and plotters of miſchief.

Here is an argument of the Lords divine providence who holds in, and lets out the enemies of the Church, as he pleaſeth: Hence we ſhould both feare the Lord, and pray to him that the enemies bee not looſed for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: as alſo to truſt in him, ſeeing againſt us, they can doe nothing contrary to the will of God, or without his permiſſion and ſufferance.

For however ſometimes the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians have obtained great victories over the Turks, yet was the ſame little or nothing conſidering their multitude, whereby in the end they have had the better of them: for ſeldome any Chriſtian army how ſtrong ſoever, hath been able to ſtand againſt them, as the largeneſſe of their empire ſufficiently witneſſeth. But uſually in their warr they have take from the Chriſtians ſome provinces, cities or ſtrong holdes. By the <hi>Greekes</hi> they have often with great loſſe of men been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed, yet at length they brought all <hi>Gracia</hi> with the <hi>Thracian</hi> &amp; <hi>Trapezuntine Empire</hi> under their power.

                        <p>The Venetians overcame them in a great fight at ſea in the yeere 1571. Yet in the mean while they ſtill held <hi>Cyprus,</hi> which they had taken away from them.

Godfrey</hi> brought to this warre ſixty thouſand foot, and an hundred thouſand horſmen: but this great armie was in a ſhort time ſo weakened by the Turkes, as that when they came to the ſiege of Ieruſalem (beeing the fourth yeare of their expedition) there were found hardlie foure and twentie thouſand ſouldiers remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Thus much generally touching the ſlaughter.</p>
                        <p>It is expreſly ſaid, that theſe adverſaries <hi>killed the third part of men, by fire, ſmoake and brimſtone:</hi> what theſe three things are, which proceeded out of their mouth: &amp; how they killed, I have ſhewed.

Otherwhile they perfidiouſly breake their leagues and ceſſations of armes made with them. And indeed the <hi>Turkiſh warre</hi> which hath continued theſe ſixteen yeeres in <hi>Hungarie,</hi> brake forth at firſt thorow their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiouſneſſe.

<note place="margin">Alcaſars frivolous gloſſe.</note> 
                           <hi>Alcaſar</hi> therefore beates the aire, in miſapplying all theſe things unto the Iewes. For without doubt (as we ſaid before) here is meant, not onely the <hi>reſt of the Eaſterne Chriſtians,</hi> and other Provinces in ſubjection to <hi>Turks:</hi> but alſo other <hi>Papiſtical Churches of the Weſt,</hi> as yet free from their yoake &amp; ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: For as the one, ſo the other were horribly guilty of the evils here mentioned, but chiefly indeed they in the Weſt.</p>
                        <p>Five of the greater ſort of ſins are named: of which their <hi>worſhipping of idols or dovils</hi> is the fountaine or ſpring. But what, have Chriſtians ever worſhipped devils?
<note place="margin">

This overthrew the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> &amp; <hi>Grecian Churches:</hi> who tooth and naile maintained the worſhip of idols and images, and eſtabliſhed the ſame by the ſecond <hi>general Councill</hi> held at <hi>Nice;</hi> but ſoon after (the Graecians beeing thruſt out) the Turkes became maſters of the towne, making it the ſeat of their Empire againſt thoſe of Conſtantinople.

Thus wee ſee what thoſe of the Eaſt ſuffered, becauſe of their idolatrie.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Which neither ſee</hi>] A deſcription of <hi>Idols</hi> taken from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.5. againſt which, what I pray you, can either the Graecian or Italian <hi>idol worſhippers</hi> juſtly object: For the <hi>idols</hi> of Chriſtians, can no more <hi>heare, ſee, nor walke,</hi> then did thoſe of the Gentiles.</p>
                        <p n="21">21 <hi>Neither of their murthers</hi>] Their other ſinne is murther both attempted by the Graecian Emperours one againſt the other, as hiſtories teſtifie: as alſo by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their mens oppreſſing each other againſt all right and reaſon: as if their had been no ruler over them, which brought deſtruction upon this Empire. Vnder one kind he comprehends all manner of injuries and oppreſſion of the innocent in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Nor of their ſorceries</hi>] Their third evill is witchcraft wherunto they of the Eaſt were much addicted: under this is comprehended all the ſuperſtitions, inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, magical &amp; deviliſh arts, which have been ſpread by Biſhops &amp; Monkes among the common ſort of Chriſtians.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="193" facs="tcp:96676:121"/>
                           <hi>Nor of their fornications</hi>] The <hi>fourth</hi> is their <hi>fornications adulteries,</hi> &amp; all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of filthineſſe, wherein the Clergie lived, under their impure unmaried eſtate.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Nor of their thefts</hi>] The <hi>fift</hi> is their thefts, ſacrilege, &amp; rapine, not ſo much committed by civil as eccleſiaſtical perſons, who by pious deceits, that is, moſt foule impoſtures, and pretence of religion <hi>devour widowes houſes,</hi> exhauſt the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuries of Princes, and great men, &amp; draw into their hands by hook and crook this worldly wealth: Theſe were the ſinnes for which the Lord by <hi>Saracens</hi> and <hi>Turkes</hi> puniſhed them of <hi>the Eaſt,</hi> to the end that their bretheren of the <hi>Weſt</hi> guilty of the ſame ſinnes might take warning by their example &amp; repent.

                        <p>
                           <hi>They repented not</hi>] He foreſhewes by the ſpirit and reproveth (not to ſpeak of them in the Eaſt ſtill remaining in their filthineſſe) the obſtinacy of the Papiſts: who openly pollute themſelves with the like <hi>idolatrie, m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Their idolatrie is manifeſt: for in all their temples, highwayes,
<note place="margin">The idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.</note> porches and corner of ſtreets they ſet up idols, the workes of mens hands, images of God of Chriſt, Marie and the Saintes: before which whoever will not fall downe and religiouſly worſhip, is accounted an haeretick &amp; condemned to the fire: They cannot abide to have them termed <hi>idols,</hi> but images ſet up, in and by them to worſhip God, Chriſt, and the Saintes. But in truth herein they <hi>worſhip the devill;</hi> for God will not be worſhipped by images: Now whatſoever is externally wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped in a religious way is an idol: and all <hi>idol worſhip</hi> is don, not unto God, but unto the devill: &amp; indeed the deſcription here of idolaters doth plainly convince them: for doe they not ſerve idols of gold, ſilver, ſtone, &amp;c. which <hi>can neither hear, ſee nor walk?</hi> an egg is not more like unto an egg, then the idols of Papiſts, and of the heathens reſemble each other.</p>
                        <p>And touching their <hi>murthers,</hi> we need goe no farther then to conſider the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable companie of Martyrs put to death by them.</p>
                        <p>As for ſorceries and all magicall arts, to whome may theſe things be applied but to the Papiſts? for in the reformed Churches now of a long time the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures of the devill and magicians are rooted out.</p>
                        <p>For fornication, adulterie, pollutions, ſodomy, they are beyond meaſure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the Popiſh clergy: for howſoever <hi>marriage is honourable among all men,</hi> yet to them it is not permitted: But <hi>ſodomie</hi> hath publickly been diſputed for: yea commended in rime by <hi>Iohannis de Caſa Archbiſhop of Benevent.</hi> what multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of whores and ſtrumpets are there at Rome? how great is the gaine which thence comes unto the Pope? It appeares by records that by them his treaſurie hath of late been augmented fourty thouſand ducats.</p>
                        <p>To be ſhort who is ignorant of the thefts, rapines and ſimonie of the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts? or who is able poſſiblie to deſcribe them? Their taxes and annales which are in print doe openlie ſhew the ſame: ſo that the Papiſts are altogether guilty of the ſame evils, for which they of the Eaſt were deſtroyed; what remaines then, but that a like puniſhment will ſurely befall them? Thus in the concluſion of this Chapter wee are taught: <hi>Firſt</hi> what was the cauſe of the great calamities befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Eaſtern world, and how the greater part of the Romane Empire was brought under the Turkiſh yoake: namely their idolatrie and much other wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe going along with it, for as the idolatrie of the <hi>Balaamites</hi> and of <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam the ſonne of Nebat</hi> cauſed the overthrow of the two powerfull kingdomes of Iſrael and Iudah by the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> &amp; <hi>Chaldaeans:</hi> So it is manifeſt, that idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie &amp; other ſinnes thereon depending, have occaſioned the deſtruction of whole Empires, and many mighty kingdomes and provinces of the Chriſtian world, as <hi>Aegypt, Palaeſtina, Damaſcena, Syria, Aſia, Cyprus, Thracia, Armenia, Myſia</hi> and part of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> So that it is not come to paſſe by chance that the <hi>Tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:96676:122"/>and ſtill doe afflict Chriſtians, but the Lord in his juſt judgement uſeth as a ſtrong rod in his hand to puniſh their impiety.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly:</hi> what is the end of the calamities inflicted? not as if God would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Church, but rather to provoke, both the idolaters thus puniſhed, and others alſo guilty of the ſame ſinnes, unto repentance: For <hi>the Lord deſidereth not the death of a ſinner, but that he repent &amp; live.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts draw the Turkes armies on Chriſtians.</note> here we are plainly taught, who they are that hitherto have, and ſtill doe draw the Turkes upon the neckes of Chriſtians, to wit, the worſhippers of idols of gold, ſilver, wood and ſtones. But who be they? are they <hi>Iaponians, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibals,</hi> or <hi>Braſilians?</hi> I affirme no: For howſoever it be granted (as theſe ſay) that theſe are worſhippers of devils: yet not they, but ours are threatned to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by the Turck &amp; Tattarian forces: but it may be demanded. Are not they of the reformed religion worſhippers of idols? I anſwere no, but rather they have quite baniſhed the ſame, ſhanning all manner of idolatrie as the peſt. But your <hi>temples,</hi> (oye Papiſts,) your <hi>Cells, Altars</hi> and <hi>Highwayes</hi> abound with images of gold, ſilver, wood &amp; ſtone: there is no corner, but ye may ſe one or other-beeing proſtrated before the image of <hi>Marie, Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul</hi> thus mutters: <hi>holie Marie,</hi> 5. <hi>Peter, S. Paul pray for mee, have mercie on me, ſave me</hi> &amp;c. Will yee deny, that you have not been the cauſe, that the <hi>Turkes</hi> for theſe ſixteen yeeres have waſted the borders of the Chriſtian world? what madneſſe is this, that ye ſhould ſtirre up Chriſtian Princes to conquer the Turke, having drawen him on your neckes by your idolatrie, and made him invincible unto this day? It is time therefore that at length yee ſeriouſly thinke of theſe things, &amp; repent of your <hi>ſorceries, thefts</hi> &amp; <hi>fornication,</hi> before the revenging hand of God deſtroy both you, and the reſt of the Chriſtian world for theſe your abominations.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly:</hi> we are taught, that probablie the reſt of the Chriſtian world, ſhall ſuffer the like judgement: becauſe the Papiſts are ſo farre from repenting of their idols and other wickedneſſe, as on the contrarie they ſtrongly maintaine the ſame and whoſoever oppoſeth them therein, they condemne as heretickes, &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute them with fire and ſword: what remaineth therefore, but that the ſame ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies who by Gods commandement have killed the third part of Chriſtians for their wickedneſſe, ſhould at length alſo come into theſe parts to kill the reſt for the like evils. For it is a conſtant rule, that <hi>they that commit like evills are worthy of like puniſhment.</hi> So that without doubt, the horrible idolatrie of Papiſts will in ſhort time draw the Turkiſh armes on the reſt of the Chriſtian world. Now whereas the Lord hath hitherto ſpared the ſame, it is to be aſcribed to the prayers of the godly groaning under the dregs of Antichriſt, &amp; to the reformed Churches, who with their whole hart doe loath his idolatrie, diſſipating to the uttermoſt of their power the ſmoake of Antichriſtian darkeneſſe, by the light of the Goſpell, that ſo the glory of Chriſt and true godlineſſe loſt among the falſe Chriſtians, may againe be reſtored and flouriſh.</p>
                        <p>Hitherto hath been treated of the <hi>first Act</hi> of <hi>the third viſion,</hi> concerning the calamities of the Church under the <hi>Romane tyrants, heretickes</hi> and <hi>hypocrites:</hi> and of the <hi>Weſtern Antichrist, king of Locusts,</hi> as alſo of the <hi>Eaſtern Angel</hi> with his armie of horſes. Which <hi>Act</hi> indeed, ſo far as concerned <hi>the king of the Locuſts</hi> was ended about the time of the <hi>Councill of Conſtans:</hi> but as for the other, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Turkiſh deſtroyer</hi> he ſhall continue unto the ſound of the <hi>ſeventh trumpet</hi> which ſhalbe bee heard in the laſt day.</p>
                        <p>Now followes the <hi>ſecond Act of this viſion,</hi> as oppoſite to the former, ſhewing remedies for theſe ſo great calamities, or comforting the godlie under ſo long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued afflictions.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd I ſaw another mighty Angel ſaying</hi>] I finde all interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (<hi>Alcaſar</hi> onely excepted who contrary to the drift of the hiſtory applies it to the Iewes) to agree in the general argument and ſcope: namely that here are inſerted (as it were) ſoveraigne medicines or conſolatory remedies in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the ſad calamities and miſeries of the Church, under their manifold enemies, but eſpecially under the <hi>Eaſterne &amp; Weſterne Antichrist,</hi> by which the godly beeing provoked to conſtancy, may be certainly perſwaded, that Chriſt the judge will alwayes take care for his people in the midſt of their greateſt perſecutions, and preſerve them in ſafety unto the end. But yet they much differ about the time: moſt reſtraine it to the times of the ſixt trumpet. But for my part I take it, that this conſolation is oppoſed to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils of all the trumpets which we have formerly heard, beeing as it were the <hi>ſecond Act of this viſion,</hi> as I have ſhewed in the argument of the Chapter. As the <hi>fift ſeal</hi> therfore in the former <hi>Viſion,</hi> contained the comforts of the martyrs <hi>under the altar,</hi> &amp; ſo reſpected the evils of the foregoing ſeales: ſo in this Viſion, the hiſtory of this Chapter annexed to the <hi>ſixt trumpet,</hi> doth containe conſolations againſt the evils of all the foregoing trumpets.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Another Angel</hi>] All interpreters for the moſt part conſent in one, that by this <hi>Angel</hi> is repreſented Chriſt the mediatour and revenger of his afflicted Church: ſome few indeed are of another minde, whoſe opinions I wil briefly ſet downe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Andreas Ceſarienſis</hi> ſuppoſeth him to bee one of the holy Angels,
<note place="margin">Andreas &amp; Riberas opinion.</note> gathering it from the <hi>cloud, rainbow, &amp; light of the ſunne</hi> here mentioned: <hi>But</hi> theſe adjuncts ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther argue the contrarie, as beeing of an higher nature then to bee applied unto a created Angel.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ribera</hi> following him, underſtands this mighty Angel to be the ſame, who in <hi>Cha.</hi> 5.2. deſired to open the book that was ſhut. For ſeeing men repented not by the plagues of the ſix trumpets, therefore he ſaith, that now a mighty Angel is ſent, who by an oath proteſts unto the world, that the end thereof, and the laſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is at hand.</p>
                     <p>But this is neither the principal ſcope, neither are his reaſons of force to prove that this ought not to be underſtood of Chriſt: And therefore <hi>Alcaſar</hi> alſo rejects them. His arguments indeed would have ſeemed the more probable, if he had made this mighty Angel, to be <hi>Gabriel,</hi> ſo called from his ſtrength: and Pſal. 103. where all the Angels of God are ſaid <hi>to excell in ſtrength: moreover</hi> that Chriſt ſhall not deſcend from heaven untill the day of judgement, according to the ſcriptures: <hi>Alſo</hi> that this Angel ſweareth by the living God, as by a greater then himſelf. <hi>But</hi> neither are theſe reaſons of waight: For <hi>Gabriel</hi> doth not ſignifie a mighty Angel, but the mighty God: Now Chriſt properly is <hi>El Gibbor, the ſtrong or mighty God.</hi> It is true indeed, that all the Angels of God are mighty: but Chriſt is ſtronger then they, as beeing the Lord of them all.</p>

                        <pb n="198" facs="tcp:96676:124"/>
Now the deſcention of this Angel from heaven muſt not be underſtood of Chriſts incarnation or any corporal deſcent on earth, but viſional, that is, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his continuall preſence with the Church: Hee, and God alſo, is ſaid to deſcend and aſcend by his preſence and manifeſtation of his grace and help. To be ſhort he ſweareth by the living God, greater then himſelf, as he is man, but not as he is the living &amp; omnipotent God: whom we have often before proved ſo to bee.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lambertus</hi> thinkes that ſome excellent miniſters of the word are here noted,
<note place="margin">Lambertus opinion.</note> whom the Lord ſent into the Church at the beginning of <hi>the ſixt trumpet:</hi> yet he ſhews not who they are, or ſhal be. But the deſcription of this Angel cannot agree to any ſuch miniſters of the word.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lyra</hi> doting,
<note place="margin">Lyras opinion.</note> (as his manner is) makes this Angel to be the Emperour <hi>Iuſtinus</hi> and his nephew <hi>Juſtinianus,</hi> about the yeere 518. who held in his hand a <hi>little booke open,</hi> that is, wrote letters to all places in favour of the Catholicks againſt the Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. But theſe acts &amp; divine deſcription are to unſolidly aſcribed unto a ſecular man.</p>
                     <p>We therefore aſſent unto the common opinion,
<note place="margin">This migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Angel is Chriſt.</note> that this Angel is CHRIST the <hi>revenger</hi> of his Church, becauſe both the deſcription of the perſon, &amp; all the acts here mentioned doe plainly make good this ſenſe: as alſo the ſcope requires the ſame. For without Chriſt, the Churches conſolation would bee verie little in all theſe things: Beſides undoubtedly this <hi>mighty Angel</hi> is the ſame, who in <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.7. is called <hi>Michael ſtanding upon the waters &amp; ſwearing by the living God:</hi> from whence this part of the viſion ſeems to be taken. But <hi>Michael</hi> the great prince ſtanding for the people was certainly Chriſt. Therefore this Angel is either Chriſt himſelf, or one repreſenting his perſon. Now we will conſider the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thites.</p>

                        <hi>Deſcending from heaven</hi>] This is farre different from that he ſaw Chap. 8.10. <hi>a ſtarre falling,</hi> &amp; Chap. 9.1. <hi>fallen from heaven.</hi> Now Chriſt deſcended from heaven for the ſalvation of man-kinde in taking our fleſh upon him: but that deſcenſion is not here intended. Againe he aſcended into heaven corporally and ſits at the right hand of God, where he is to remaine untill the day of judgement. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw him deſcending, not by a locall motion, but by viſionall grace, inaſmuch as he commeth down by the preſence of his ſpirit and ſpecial help to relieve the afflicted condition of his Church, not leaving her comfortleſſe, according to the promiſe: <hi>where two or three are gathered together in my name, I am in the midst of them.

Now the likeneſſe of the deſcription ſhewes, that the ſame is here intended.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Clothed with a cloud</hi>] Some underſtand this <hi>cloud</hi> to be meant of Chriſts fleſh, hiding or covering his divinity: Others for the obſcure knowledge, by which he revealed himſelf unto the world in the time of <hi>the ſixt trumpet,</hi> beeing (as it were) as yet covered with great darkneſſe: making the ſenſe thus: hee appeared <hi>clothed with a cloud,</hi> that is, he manifeſted himſelf in an obſcure or darke way unto the world. For my owne part I take it (according the manner of the ſcripture) to be a ſigne of divine majeſty. For <hi>Iehovah</hi> was wont to appeare unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in a cloud, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 6.1. the <hi>cloud</hi> alſo leading the people in the wilderneſſe, &amp; ſheltering them from the heat of the ſunne, was Chriſt: Therefore he is <hi>clothed with a cloud,</hi> to ſhew that he is Lord of a heavenly nature.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And the rainebow on his head</hi>] The <hi>rainebow</hi> ſignifies grace, beeing ſett by God as a ſigne,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.13.</note> that he would not ſend the floud any more upon the earth. Chriſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore appeares crowned with a rainebow, as the meſſenger of grace &amp; peace; for
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:96676:124"/>he is our peace <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.14. &amp; <hi>the prince of peace, Iſa.</hi> 9.6. This ſigne was very fit for the time confirming tidings of peace with God to the afflicted Church: ſhortlie to reſt from all her troubles, and enjoy future happineſſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>His face was as the Sunne</hi>] Thus alſo in Chap. 1.16. it is ſaid, <hi>Chriſts face ſhone as the ſunne ſhineth in his ſtrength,</hi> that is, it was moſt cleare, &amp; ſhining in ful bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: For hee is the <hi>ſun of righteouſneſſe</hi> illuminating his Church, &amp; clearing up the ſtormes of afflictions. For as the ſunne in its vigour, diſſipates the cloudes, drives away cold, alayes the windes, and brings a ſerenity: ſo Chriſt by the brightneſſe of his ſpirit of grace, will aſſwage the ſtormes of afflictions, diſſipate the tempeſts of calamities, and bring unto the faithfull a quietneſſe of conſcience in the midſt of all their troubles, &amp; at laſt by the cleare beames of his countenance will diſpell all manner of adverſitie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>His feet as pillars of fire</hi>] In <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.15. Chriſts <hi>feet were as fine braſſe, burning as in a fornace:</hi> by which metaphor the power and ſtrength of Chriſt is ſignified; for <hi>pillars</hi> by their ſtrength underprop &amp; ſupport the houſe: Fire conſumes chaffe, &amp; other things: ſo Chriſt appeares here with ſuch <hi>feet,</hi> who by his power and ſtrength will ſtand faſt againſt the adverſaries &amp; Antichriſt: the Church he will purge &amp; defend, but conſume the enemies like ſtubble.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto we have heard the deſcription of the Angel, who doth in this manner ſhew himſelf unto Iohn, that the Church groaning under the burden of afflictions, might know, that Chriſt will come to revenge and relieve her deplorable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, eſpecially under the <hi>fift and ſixt trumpets:</hi> for hee will be preſent with his Church in all her troubles, becauſe hee is <hi>crowned with a rainbow:</hi> as alſo he is pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull to aſſwage the tempeſts of calamities, as having a <hi>face like the ſunne,</hi> whom the ſcorpionlike Locuſts, with their horſes, and Lyons heads, and tailes like ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents ſhall no way terrifie, or overthrow: becauſe by his feet, as with <hi>fiery pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,</hi> he ſo ſettles his kingdome, as it cannot be moved: to be ſhort hee eaſily can deſtroy Antichriſt with all his Locuſts ariſing out of the pit, ſeeing he is <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>But what may bee the meaning,
<note place="margin">Why Chriſt holdeth the booke open in his hand.</note> that Chriſt holds this <hi>little booke open in his hand?</hi> The book was written within &amp; without: <hi>within,</hi> were contained the ſecrets of future things to bee revealed unto Iohn: <hi>without,</hi> was writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the doctrine of the Goſpell before publiſhed &amp; penned by the Apoſtles.

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:96676:125"/>Therefore Chriſt now appears, holding the ſame open in his hand, thereby teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, <hi>first,</hi> that, not withſtanding the perfecution of tyrants, the ſuperſtitions, and lyes of Antichriſt, by which he darkened the doctrine of Goſpell, yet he held forth in his hand the booke of his word, that is, raiſed up continually ſome faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full profeſſours and teachers of the truth who maintained the ſame againſt all ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants and Antichriſts: And indeed the bookes of martyrs, and other eccleſiaſtical hiſtories doe abundantly witneſſe, that there have been multitudes of ſuch, not onely during the perſecution of the <hi>Romane Emperours,</hi> and hereticks, but alſo theſe thouſand yeeres many under Antichriſt, condemned &amp; cruelly put to death for hereſie. But <hi>ſecondly</hi> it teacheth us, that at laſt he will alſo purge his booke from the pollutions of <hi>the Locusts</hi> &amp; dregs of Antichriſt, by fit witneſſes of his truth, whom in the laſt times he will raiſe up for that end, in the midſt of Antichriſts kingdome.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And he ſet his right foot upon the ſea</hi>] The following actions of the Angel illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the matter going before: For in that he <hi>ſet his feet upon the ſea and earth, cried as when a lyon roareth, cauſed the thunders to utter their voyces, and ſware by the living God:</hi> all this tends, to give us to underſtand, that Chriſt ſuffered not the booke of his doctrine to bee wrung out of his hand, neither by the Romane tyrants, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, Antichriſtian Locuſts, or the devouring armies of Mahumet, but alwayes kept the ſame open in the world.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>His right foot</hi>] The <hi>feet of Christ,</hi> are ſaid before, to be like <hi>pillars of fire.</hi> Many (and among the reſt my <hi>Anonymus,</hi>) underſtand this of the preachers of the word: The <hi>right,</hi> to be ſome eminent ones: The <hi>left</hi> inferiour miniſters: for the left foot is weaker then the right. By the <hi>ſea</hi> they underſtand the world: by the <hi>earth</hi> worldly men. Now he ſets his <hi>right foot upon the ſea, his left on the earth:</hi> that is, by his miniſters both of high &amp; lower degree, he reproved earthly mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Brightman</hi> much to the ſame purpoſe, underſtands the <hi>right foot,</hi> to be Chriſts faithfull ſervants, whom he raiſed up againſt Antichriſt out of the <hi>ſea,</hi> that is, out of the <hi>viperous brood</hi> of the <hi>Popiſh clergie,</hi> as, <hi>William Ockam, John Wickleffe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>his left foot,</hi> of ſecular princes, as, <hi>Ludovick</hi> of <hi>Bavaria</hi> the Emperour, <hi>Marſilius</hi> of <hi>Padua, Dantes,</hi> &amp;c. who with all their might ſtrongly oppoſed the monſtrous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of Antichriſt.</p>
                     <p>But we need not make uſe of ſo ſubtile an allegorie. This part of the Viſion is taken out of Dan 12.7. where <hi>Michael the great prince ſtanding for his people,</hi> is ſaid to have <hi>ſet his feet on the waters of the river.</hi> In which place no doubt is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the great armies of the <hi>Babylonians</hi> at the <hi>River Euphrates,</hi> whom the Lord ſo reſtrained &amp; kept down by his providence, as that they could not deſtroy his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple according to their own pleaſure: So Chriſt here <hi>ſets his feet upon the ſea and the earth,</hi> (for ſo Iohn ſaw him truely ſtanding in a viſion,) but to what end?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To ſet the foot</hi> anywhere, is to challenge the poſſeſſion and dominion thereof to himſelfe.
<note place="margin">How Chriſt ſet his feet on the earth &amp; ſea.</note> The <hi>earth</hi> and <hi>ſea</hi> denotes the whole world, with all that is therein. In this place therefore is ſignified, that when Chriſt ſhall ſeem to have loſt his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion in the <hi>earth &amp; ſea,</hi> yet then he ſhall ſet <hi>one foot upon the ſea,</hi> that is, the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſt provinces &amp; Ilands: And his other <hi>foot upon the earth,</hi> that is, the mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean regions of the Chriſtian world, as preſerving in all places ſome remnants of a Church unto himſelf. But when? Here now we are to have regard unto the times of the <hi>ſix trumpets:</hi> for howbeit in Iohns time <hi>Domitian,</hi> and after him <hi>Aurelius, Commodus, Diocletian, Maximian,</hi> &amp; other tyrants perſecuted the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians both by ſea &amp; land, and indeavoured to root out the verie name of Chriſt: Notwithſtanding Chriſt <hi>ſet his foot on the ſea and on the earth:</hi> for the Chriſtian Church diſperſed throughout the whole earth increaſed the more, by how much it was perſecuted. Hee <hi>ſet his foot on the ſea and earth,</hi> by the Chriſtian Emperours <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and others, at what time the whole world ſeemed to be in ſubjection to Chriſt. Afterward again when Chriſt in outward appearance ſeemed to be
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:96676:125"/>thruſt out of his poſſeſſion by the <hi>Arian, Macedonian, Neſtorian, Eutychinian, Manichean,</hi> &amp; <hi>Pelagian hereticks:</hi> yet then he ſtill held his foot faſt upon the earth &amp; ſea, for he preſerved continually ſome faithful Teachers &amp; Biſhops, who being zealous of his glory kept alwayes his poſſeſſion.</p>
                     <p>But chiefly when the <hi>Biſhops of Rome fell from heaven unto the earth, turning the doctrine of Christ into wormwood, &amp; opening the bottomleſſe pit,</hi> whence came out the peſtilent ſmoake of their abominations, with thoſe <hi>devouring Locusts,</hi> which tormented men for <hi>five moneths:</hi> as alſo when the <hi>Mahumetane, Saracen, Arabian</hi> &amp; <hi>Turkiſh</hi> armies horribly deſtroyed and overthrew all the Chriſtian Churches in the Eaſt, to the great hazard, as it ſeemed, of Chriſts government and kingdom: yet behold even then Chriſt <hi>ſet his foot upon the earth and ſea:</hi> For he had during al the time of Antichriſts reigne in the Weſt, alwayes ſome remnants in the midſt of Poperie, and raiſed up verie many witneſſes of his truth: In the Eaſt alſo ſome Churches, however burthened with the Turkiſh tyrannie, were preſerved, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the name of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>This therefore is a third conſolation for the godly, that they might not, being under the calamities of the ſix trumpets, be diſcouraged: For neyther tyrants, nor hereticks, nor Antichriſts, ſhall ever put Chriſt ſo out of his poſſeſſion, as not to have <hi>his feet ſtill ſtanding upon the earth &amp; upon the ſea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>And he cryed with a great voyce</hi>] This cry, and roaring of Chriſt ſerves alſo to comfort the godly, and declares the two former acts. For as he will hold <hi>a booke open, and ſet his foot upon the earth &amp; ſea,</hi> ſo he will not be ſilent or mute, but have the Goſpell to be preached: The ſaving efficacie whereof unto the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full is ſignified by the <hi>great voyce,</hi> but the dreadful effect applied unto the wicked, by the <hi>roaring of a Lyon.</hi> Now here againe, we are to returne to the times of the <hi>ſix trumpets.</hi> For the more that tyrants laboured to ſuppreſſe the Goſpell, the louder &amp; greater was the voyce: <hi>the Lyon of the tribe of Juda,</hi> as he is called <hi>Cha.</hi> 5.5. roared, and prevailed, that is, Chriſtians embraced the Goſpel, and joyfully ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered marty rdome for the ſame. It is true the enemies did mightily rage, yet were they tormented with a ſecret dread fearing they knew not what: like as of old the <hi>Scribes, Phariſees, &amp; chiefe Priests</hi> taking counſell againſt Chriſt were ſore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed: <hi>What doe we?</hi> (ſay they) <hi>for this man doth many miracles:

                     <p>Here then we ſee in the <hi>first place,</hi> that an <hi>Oath</hi> is a kind of invocation upon God: and therefore often in ſcripture, ſwearing is put for invocating, and ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine invocation for the other: As <hi>Iſa.</hi> 19.18. <hi>The nations ſhall ſweare by Iehovah,</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly</hi> hence we ſee that to ſweare by Angels,
<note place="margin">It is a great wickedneſſe to ſweare by the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> Saintes, or any other creature, is a horrible wickedneſſe: both becauſe they cannot ſearch the hart &amp; reines, in which regard they are vainly called upon: <hi>as alſo</hi> becauſe religious invocation is a worſhip onely proper to God, &amp; cannot without ſacriledge bee given unto any other. They therefore who ſweare by <hi>Mary,</hi> &amp; the Saintes, doe as much offend the Lord, deceive themſelves and others, as SOCRATES who was wont to ſweare by his dog, or any ſtone whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>But here it may bee demanded, if this Angel be Chriſt himſelf, how then doth he ſweare by him <hi>that liveth for ever?</hi> For hereby it ſeems either that he is not Chriſt, or els that Chriſt is not true God, but inferiour unto him, becauſe he ſweares by <hi>the living God,</hi> as by one greater then himſelf.</p>
                     <p>To this I have given ſomewhat in anſwer before, and ſufficiently ſhewed that Chriſt is this Angel. <hi>He ſweareth by him that liveth for ever,</hi> as hee is man and the mediatour, &amp; ſo he acknowledgeth God to be above him: according as he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Io.</hi> 14.28.</note> 
                        <hi>The Father is greater then I.</hi> Or els as he is God, and then he <hi>ſweareth by him who liveth for ever,</hi> not as by a ſuperiour, or by another, but by himſelf, according to that in Heb. 6.13. <hi>becauſe God could ſweare by no greater he ſware by himſelf.</hi> But that Chriſt is he that liveth for ever appeares by his owne teſtimony Chap. 1.18. <hi>I live</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>&amp; was dead,</hi>

                        </note> to wit, as man: <hi>and behold I live for ever and ever.</hi> This therefore (as we have before noted) yeeldeth us a worthy argument to prove the deity of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Who created heaven</hi>] By this other Epithite he alſo diſtinguiſheth the true God from idols, as beeing <hi>the onely creatour of all things in heaven &amp; in earth, &amp;c.</hi> gave them, I ſay, at firſt a beeing of nothing: the which was a worke of omnipotencie, not to be effected by falſe gods or any creature. Therefore the true God every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in ſcripture, as alſo in the <hi>common creed</hi> is celebrated as the creatour of all things:

                     <p>
                        <hi>That there ſhould be time no longer</hi>] Now followes what Chriſt ſware, and to what end. Both which are to the ſame purpoſe: for the latter adverſitively ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds the former: viz. that there ſhould bee no more time, but that the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the myſtery of God was at hand under the <hi>ſeventh trumpet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The former is taken diverſe wayes: ANDREAS: <hi>he ſweareth there ſhould bee no time after, or, in the world to come, or, not long after the ſixt trumpet:</hi> the latter part of whoſe opinion is agreable to the ſcope, but not the former, (notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding <hi>Ribera</hi> fooliſhly approves therof:) <hi>there ſhalbe no time</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>becauſe this variety of time, as dayes, nightes, moneths &amp; yeeres ſhalbe no more: but an unchangable eternity ſhall follow in the dayes of the ſeventh Angel.</hi> But what uſe was there to confirme that with an Oath, which no man is ignorant of, viz. that after the conſummation of this world, time ſhallbe ſwallowed up by eternity. <hi>Alcaſar</hi> wreſteth it unto the Iewes, <hi>to whom there ſhalbe no more time,</hi> as beeing threatned of God to be forſaken. But what need was there that Chriſt ſhould ſignifie a thing by viſion and Oath, which long before was clearly declared: <hi>Behold your houſe is left unto you deſolate,</hi> Matt. 23.28.</p>
                     <p>BRIGHTMAN: <hi>there ſhalbe no more time,</hi> that is, <hi>no longer delay, but a verie little time ſhalbe remaining untill the conſummation of the myſterie:</hi> the which is agreable unto the ſcope of the place: for Chriſt by a <hi>fift</hi> conſolation would encourage the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, taken from the brevity of the time remaining, leaſt they beeing diſhartned in regard of the long &amp; continued calamities of the <hi>ſix trumpets,</hi> ſhould be out of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:96676:127"/>hope, as if there ſhould never be an end of their miſeries, but that Antichriſts rage ſhould allwayes continue in the world. But it ſhall not bee ſo, for the end is neere at hand, as Chriſt ſwearing by himſelf confirmes, to the end we might no way doubt thereof: ſo that this <hi>Oath</hi> ſerves, both for the confirmation of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and for our conſolation alſo: neyther indeed doth Chriſt uſe on oath without waighty cauſe; for Antichriſt had ſo eſtabliſhed his poſſeſſion, as that it ſeemed impoſſible that his kingdom ſhould be overthrown: Therefore Chriſt ſweareth, that <hi>there ſhould bee no more time,</hi> to wit, ſad and mornefull unto the Saintes, as hitherto it had been under tyrants, and eſpecially under Antichriſt, who onely bearing ſwaye, tyrannized over all, inſomuch as no man might contradict him, unleſſe he meant to die for it by fire or ſword: But there ſhall follow other times, wherein ſhal be a reformation of the Church, &amp; the laſt down fall of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts kingdome.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The myſterie of God ſhall be finiſhed</hi>] When? <hi>In the dayes of the ſeventh trumpet,</hi> that is, ſo ſoon as it ſhall begin to blow: then ſhall be the end of the <hi>ſixt trumpet,</hi> the end of the Churches calamities, &amp; the end of Antichriſtian tyranny.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alcaſar</hi> applies the <hi>myſteries of God,</hi> to the caſting off the Iewes, and election of the Gentiles. But the moſt on the contrarie underſtand it of the myſterie of all Iſraels converſion unto Chriſt, which ſhal to come to paſſe neer the laſt times, of which the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.25. ſeems to treat: and indeed the prophets of old have often propheſied of their calling. But becauſe in this place the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the Church militant under Antichriſt is onely aimed at, unto which the calling of the Iewes doth not directly much belong, therefore it is rather &amp; better to be taken of the reſurrection and day of judgement, even when the power of tyrants and all adverſaries ſhall be aboliſhed: of which myſterie the Apoſtle ſpeaketh 1 Cor. 15.51. <hi>Behold I ſhew you a myſterie, wee ſhall not all ſleepe, but wee ſhall all bee changed, in a moment in the twinckling of an eye at the last trumpet: for the trumpet ſhall blow, and we ſhall be changed.</hi> This is that which Chriſt here ſweareth, that at the <hi>ſound of the ſeventh trumpet</hi> the myſterie of God is to be finiſhed, the Church delivered and glorified, but the enemies e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally to be puniſhed: according unto that in the Prophets: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24.26.27.66. <hi>Daniel</hi> 7.11.12. <hi>Zacha.</hi> 14. <hi>Mala.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.</p>
                     <p>Hence we plainely ſee, that the ſound of the <hi>ſixt trumpet</hi> ſhall continue unto the <hi>end of time,</hi> that is, of this world: and that at the beginning of the ſound of <hi>the ſeventh trumpet,</hi> an end ſhall be put to the afflictions of the Church, and cruelty of the adverſaries. The <hi>ſeventh trumpet</hi> therefore, is no other then that of the <hi>Archangel,</hi> by which the dead ſhal be raiſed out of their graves, and brought to judgement. As in the following Chapter we ſhall hear, ſo that without all doubt this <hi>trumpet</hi> reſpects the end of the world. They therfore doe erre from the ſcope, who extend the time of the <hi>ſeven Vialls,</hi> and of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing viſions, beyond the <hi>ſeventh trumpet.</hi>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He other part of the Chapter concerning the <hi>booke eaten by John,</hi> is a preparation to the following <hi>Act,</hi> touching the combat of the <hi>two witneſſes</hi> with the beaſt, about the end of the <hi>fift</hi> &amp; <hi>ſixt trumpets,</hi> which yet remaine founding in this preſent age. <hi>John</hi> (as he is commanded,) <hi>eats up the little booke he tooke out of the hand of Christ: the which was ſweet in his mouth, but bitter in his belly:</hi> And he is commanded <hi>to propheſie againe before kings and nations.</hi> Now what is this? but that towards the laſt times, <hi>propheſying</hi> ſhallbe renewed againſt Antichriſt: after which indeed there ſhall follow new combats, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Antichriſts kingdome ſhall be greeviouſly ſhaken: the which beeing donne, <hi>there ſhall be no more time,</hi> that is, like the former, when Antichriſt raged according to his luſt and pleaſure over the Church. <hi>This is the ſumme.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now we are well to take notice, that this part of the viſion is taken out of the propheſie of <hi>Ezech. Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>where an hand from heaven reacheth unto the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet a roule, to eat it up, beeing in his mouth as hony for ſweetneſſe: whereupon he is commanded to denounce judgements against the Iſraelites.</hi> It ſhadowed out the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly call of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> as alſo his readines to obey God, in reproving the vices of the people, and threatning puniſhment againſt them for the ſame. All things are here alike: But that <hi>Ezechiel</hi> felt not the booke (as <hi>John,</hi>) bitter in his belly: &amp; that he was ſent to propheſie againſt the houſe of Iſrael, but Iohn againſt Antichriſt. Let us briefly conſider, who commandeth, what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and what followed upon the doing thereof.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>And the voyce which I heard</hi>] To wit, that heavenly voyce mentioned in ver. 4. <hi>write not, but ſeale the voyces of the thunders,</hi> &amp;c. The ſame voyce there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who before forbade him to write, doth now command him <hi>to eat up the little booke, and to propheſie;</hi> by which is ſignified the admirable diſpenſation of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace: for Antichriſt bearing ſway in the Church during the times of <hi>the fift &amp; ſixt trumpets, the thunders indeed uttered their voyces,</hi> that is, ſome faithfull tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers publickly thundered againſt the idolatrie and tyranny of Antichriſt: But with little profit: The <hi>voyces</hi> remained ſealed, and Antichriſts power entire, yea increaſed dayly by ſuppreſſing thoſe teachers, &amp; bringing kings and nations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his yoak. Now whence came this? I anſwere, Chriſt as yet had not given to <hi>John</hi> the <hi>open booke to eat it up:</hi> neither commanded him againe to propheſie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he reſerved this ſpecial grace unto the later times of the <hi>fift &amp; ſixt trumpets.</hi> Let us therefore acknowledge this ſingular mercie of God, that now unto us the <hi>open booke</hi> of Chriſts doctrine is given to be eaten up, and propheſie againſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt againe revived in the world.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take the little booke</hi>] The heavenly voyce commands two things. <hi>First,</hi> that Iohn ſhould take the open booke out of the hand of Chriſt. <hi>Secondly,</hi> eat it up. The <hi>little booke</hi> on the outſide contained the revealed &amp; written doctrine of the Goſpell: <hi>within</hi> the ſecret counſels of God touching the future events of the Church. For it was written, <hi>within and without,</hi> as we heard <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.7. and <hi>Ezech.</hi> 2.10. This <hi>little booke</hi> Chriſt both opened, and held open: teaching us, that as <hi>Iohn,</hi> ſo all the teachers of the word, muſt ask of Chriſt, and receive out of his hand the doctrine of ſalvation, which they are to propound unto the Church: but not from the hand of Satan or Antichriſt. Now he exhibiteth a <hi>booke open,</hi>
                        <pb n="207" facs="tcp:96676:128"/>becauſe the holy ſcriptures doe open, and manifeſtly ſet forth the myſteries of our ſalvation. Thus we ſee <hi>the decrees of the Romiſh Antichrist, the traditions of Popes and Councils, the humane Philoſophie and ſubtilties of Sophiſters</hi> are to be quite bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed out of the Church. It is expreſſely added, <hi>Of the Angel that ſtood upon the earth, and ſea</hi>] that we might confidently reſt on the power of Chriſt, and acknowledge him alone to be the revealer of the heavenly truth, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire nothing as neceſſarie to ſalvation, but what we take out of his hand.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Take it, and eat it up</hi>] This is the other commandement. Bookes of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or parchment are not to be eaten <hi>properly,</hi> as not beeing fit food for man; but they are ſaid to be eaten up <hi>metaphorically,</hi> when they are ſo carefully read and throughly taken notice of, that we are able promptly to rehearſe and diſcourſe of the contents thereof. So a man is ſaid to have devoured <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgil, Cicero,</hi> who is fullie acquainted with them, and hath them, as it were, by heart. So <hi>Cicero</hi> called <hi>M. Cato a devourer of bookes,</hi> becauſe he was an inſatiable reader. Thus, as the Prophet in <hi>Ezech.</hi> 3. ſo <hi>John</hi> here, is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>to eat up the booke he received of Christ,</hi> that is, well to underſtand and as it were, hide the ſame in the bowels of his heart, that ſo he might deliver no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doctrine unto the Church, but what hee had received from Chriſt. Now whether this booke were eaten up trulie, or in a viſion onely, makes little to the purpoſe: the latter is moſt probable. For all theſe things were don by a viſion.</p>
                     <p>Here the miniſters of the word are taught earneſtly to devoure, or eat up the doctrine of ſalvation divinely written &amp; received from Chriſt, that is, diligently to read, underſtand, ſearch, meditate, &amp; as it were to turne it even into their verie moiſture &amp; blood. For ſuch onely can faithfully inſtruct the Church in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth, who after this manner meditate in the law of the Lord day &amp; night. On the contrary their ſluggiſhneſſe is condemned, who though they love to be called <hi>Biſhops, Archbiſhops</hi> &amp; <hi>Patriarchs of the Church,</hi> yet in the mean while are little or nothing acquainted with the ſcriptures of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And it ſhall make thy belly bitter</hi>] He preadmoniſheth Iohn of a double effect of the booke, <hi>ſweet in the mouth, bitter in the belly.</hi> Sweet things are delightfull to the palate, bitter things provoke to vomit. Hereby ſignifying, that one effect thereof ſhould be ſweet, the other troubleſome: the nature whereof is expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the following verſe. He fore ſhewes it ſhould be <hi>ſweet,</hi> to ſtir him up the more earneſtly to <hi>eat up the booke:</hi> he tels him alſo that it ſhould be bitter, that he might not afterward bee offended thereat: but know that this bitterneſſe ſhould bee recompenſed with much ſweetneſſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Then I tooke the booke</hi>] He ſhewes his readineſſe in <hi>eating the book:</hi> for neither the difficulty of the command, nor the bitterneſſe of the book diſhartens him: ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, that we are readily to ſubmitt unto the command of God, &amp; not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed at any hardſhips or difficulties whatſoever. Now <hi>he ate the booke</hi> not really, but in viſion onely, as I ſaid before, ſignifying that he moſt readily accepted the worke impoſed upon him, of which it followeth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And it was ſweet in my mouth</hi>] Here the foreſaid effects follow. This booke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaten was ſweet in the mouth, and bitter in the belly: the firſt ſignifies the ſweetneſſe of the word, as Pſal. 119.103. <hi>How ſweet are thy words unto my taste, yea ſweeter then hony to my mouth.</hi> Ierem. 15.16. <hi>Thy words were found, &amp; I did eat them, &amp; thy word was unto mee the joy &amp; rejoycing of myne heart.</hi> This is the proper effect of the word, it brings joy to the heart, &amp; comfort to the conſcience: yea &amp; by how much faithfull teachers doe feel this ſweetneſſe, by ſo much the more they preach the Goſpell chearfully. But the effect thereof is bitter by accident, becauſe the preaching of the word occaſioneth moſt painefull grypings of the belly, as the hatred of the world, perſecutions, baniſhments, &amp; martyrdomes. This effect Chriſt foretold unto his diſciples: <hi>They ſhall put you out of their ſynagogues,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.2.</note> &amp; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever killeth you will thinke that he doth God ſervice.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="208" facs="tcp:96676:129"/>
But what uſe was there to reveale this in a type unto <hi>John:</hi> ſeeing it was long before plainely foretold in the written word? It was altogether needfull, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that this <hi>bitterneſſe</hi> doth not properly denote the calamities already paſt under the <hi>four trumpets,</hi> but to come in the end of the <hi>fift &amp; ſixt,</hi> under the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Antichriſt, the which we ſhall heare in the following Chapter, namely the combats of the <hi>third Act of this Viſion.</hi> He foretold them therefore unto <hi>Iohn,</hi> that he might not bee offended: for he had already experience hereof, beeing ſent into exile by <hi>Domitian:</hi> notwithſtanding Chriſt doth not properly intend this here, but praefigures in his perſon the future calamities of the witneſſes of the truth.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. <hi>And hee ſaid unto me</hi>] To wit, the former voyce from heaven.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thou muſt againe propheſie</hi>] This commandement is taken diverſly. <hi>Lyra: thou must write downe more propheſies,</hi> to wit thoſe which follow in this booke. <hi>But</hi> to write more things, is not <hi>againe to propheſie,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                        <hi>Thomas, Rupertus,</hi> and ſome others underſtand it hiſtorically, of <hi>Iohns</hi> beeing reſtored unto his Church: as if he had ſaid, <hi>Thou must after the death of Domitian returne</hi> from <hi>Patmos the place of thy exile unto Epheſus, and preach againe the Goſpell:</hi> or, as if it were a promiſe of writing his Goſpell after the <hi>Revelation.</hi> The which <hi>Ribera</hi> refuteth: <hi>This</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I approve not of, for to put propheſying in ſtead of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Goſpell, is new:</hi> which reaſon is not ſolid: he adds another: <hi>that ſeeing John was gifted with the fulneſſe of the holy Ghost, therefore he needed not to eat up the booke, eyther for to preach, or, to write the Goſpell;</hi> wherefore he ſaith, the ſenſe is thus: <hi>that although Iohn hitherto had propheſied many things concerning the laſt times, notwithſtanding there remained as yet many things of the ſame nature, which he was to propheſie of, against the gentiles, &amp;c.</hi> The which is one with the opinion of <hi>Lyra,</hi> &amp; which <hi>Alcaſar</hi> alſo with his ſubtilties doth at laſt come unto. <hi>But</hi> hee needed not to eat up the booke in this reſpect: ſeeing before he had received a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement to write the whole Revelation: &amp; allthough I grant that <hi>Lyras</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion touching the promiſe of Iohns reſtitution is to be approved off, yet the <hi>eating of the booke,</hi> doth make nothing for it. <hi>Andreas,</hi> and they which follow him, perceiving that here is ſpoken of propheſying to come in the laſt times, have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined (much like to the diſciples of old) that <hi>Iohn</hi> is not dead to this day, but yet liveth with <hi>Enoch</hi> &amp; <hi>Elias</hi> in paradiſe, with whom, after Antichriſt is riſen, he ſhall come and propheſie againſt him. Touching whoſe opinion ſo much indeed is true, viz: that here is treated of a future propheſying under Antichriſt: but the reſt is falſe and refuted by Iohn himſelf: Chap. 21.23.</p>
                     <p>All the forenamed opinions therefore are to bee joyned together, and then the meaning will appear to be thus: that here is a confirmation of the Prophet, that he ſhould not, becauſe of his baniſhment, deſiſt from his office, but goe on to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie: and thus the commandement may include a promiſe of his reſtitution in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his former place: Yet the heavenly voyce is further to be applied, namely, to the propheſying which ſhould be renewed againſt Antichriſt in the laſt times. So that <hi>Iohn</hi> is commanded to <hi>eat up the book, &amp; againe to propheſie,</hi> not ſo much in his owne, as in the perſon of all thoſe witneſſes of the truth who lived neer the end of the <hi>fift and ſixt trumpets:</hi> the ſence is therefore, that when Antichriſt hath long enough raged, then propheſying ſhall againe be reſtored againſt him, &amp;c. Now <hi>to propheſie againe,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">To prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie againe what it is.</note> is to bring to light, purge, reforme &amp; wholy to reſtore to its former brightneſſe the doctrine of the Goſpell, filthily polluted, mangled, &amp; brought to nought by <hi>Antichriſts Locuſts. Againe</hi>] for although the Apoſtles, Paſtors, Teachers &amp; ſincere Biſhops had formerly publiſhed &amp; preached the Goſpell, yet afterward propheſie was oppreſſed by Antichriſt: and therefore it was behovefull it ſhould <hi>againe</hi> be reſtored by the faithfull preachers of the word. <hi>This,</hi> I ſay, <hi>must be don,</hi> for otherwiſe Antichriſt, would have thruſt Chriſt quite out of his poſſeſſion, &amp; troaden his Church under foot. Therefore for the truthes ſake of theſe divine praedictions, &amp; that the Church periſh not, but that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:96676:129"/>abominations be wholy rooted out, it was needfull that <hi>propheſie</hi> ſhould bee renewed. The <hi>Thunders</hi> indeed uttered their voyces, but they did little good: &amp; therefore other witneſſes muſt be raiſed up, who ſhall more ſtrongly ſtrike at, aſſault &amp; weaken Antichriſts kingdome. Thus it is manifeſt, that here is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed a reformation of the Church about the laſt times, which ſhalbe expounded in the following Chapter under the <hi>two witneſſes,</hi> who ſhall againe propheſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Antichriſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Before many people, and nations, and tongues and kings</hi>] The ſucceſſe of propheſie renewed is ſet forth: for hereby many peoples nations, and kings, who before worſhipped the beaſt, ſhall embrace the Goſpell, &amp; forſake Antichriſt. The which how far it hath, and yet daylie is accompliſhed both in <hi>Germanie, France, England, Poland, Bohemia, Hungary, Denmarke &amp; Suetia,</hi> &amp;c. all may clearly ſee, who doe not malitiouſly ſhut their eyes.

                        <note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of Ezech. tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the meaſuring of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall.</note> in which viſion God promiſed the reſtauration of the temple deſtroyed by the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> not indeed materially but ſpiritually under the Goſpel. For the outward temple built by <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> after their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, doth not at all anſwer to the dimenſions of that viſion, neither ſhall any one be like unto it: and therefore that meaſuring was a propheſie of the future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the ſpirituall temple by Chriſt. By the like metaphor the reſtoring of Ieruſalem is promiſed in Zach. 1.16. <hi>My houſe ſhall be built in it, ſaith the Lord of hoſtes, &amp; a line ſhall be ſtretched forth upon Ieruſalem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So here by the like reaſon, in that <hi>Iohn</hi> is bid <hi>to meaſure the temple,</hi> is ſignified, that the ſame ſhould be ſo waſted, rent and overthrowen, as that of neceſſitie it muſt be <hi>meaſured,</hi> that is, reformed &amp; built againe. This worke <hi>Iohn</hi> is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſet himſelf upon, that is, by this type to foretell what ſhould come to paſſe, viz. that after Antichriſt had taken poſſeſſion, waſted &amp; oppreſſed the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, then Chriſt by <hi>giving the meaſuring reed unto his two witneſſes,</hi> would
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:96676:131"/>againe meaſure, repaire, &amp; wholy renew the ſame. Thus we ſe that this command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>meaſuring the Temple,</hi> is a propheticall promiſe, of the reformation of the Church, waſted and ruinated by the <hi>Weſterne Antichrist.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence the Papiſts fiction is refuted, that <hi>the viſible Church can never degenerate,
<note place="margin">The viſible Church could erre, ſeeing it had need of meaſuring.</note> erre &amp; fal from her integrity.</hi> But the thing it ſelf ſhewes the vanity hereof: The <hi>old Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> according to <hi>Ribera,</hi> was a type of the Church: Now we know that might be, &amp; was laid waſt &amp; deſtroyed, yea the <hi>old Church</hi> it ſelf very often degenerated: The <hi>new Church</hi> alſo ſhalbe poſſeſſed &amp; troden under foot by Antichriſt, &amp; ſo need a new meaſuring, or reparation. Wherefore it cannot be denied, but that the Church may be deſtroyed &amp; degenerate from the faith of Chriſt unto Antichriſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Furthermore</hi> it is manifeſt that the Church diſſipated by Antichriſt, neither can be, nor ſhalbe <hi>meaſured</hi> by any other inſtrument, then by the <hi>reed of the word,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the holy Scriptures, as being indeed the onely true &amp; infallible rule,

                     <p n="1">I. There was an <hi>outmost court,</hi> in which the people were converſant.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. A more <hi>inward,</hi> or <hi>middle court</hi> for the keeping of the <hi>Leviticall inſtruments,</hi> &amp; making ready of the ſacrifices.</p>

                     <p n="4">IV.

He muſt alſo <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the Altar</hi> to wit, the <hi>golden Altar,</hi> from the <hi>foure corners</hi> whereof hee heard a voyce Cha. 9.13. This was a type of Chriſt. But how? Is he commanded to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure Chriſt? yea verely. For Chriſt under a pretence of his name was thruſt out of his poſſeſſion by Antichriſt, who ſuppreſſed the faith &amp; turned Chriſtian libertie into miſerable ſervitude. The <hi>Altar</hi> therefore of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhalbe meaſured, when as the faith of Chriſt ſhalbe freed from the perfidiouſnes of Antichriſt, &amp; Chriſtian liberty from his tyranny.

Theſe therfore in the <hi>court,</hi> are thoſe that worſhip not Chriſt: but adminiſter Antichriſts holy things, &amp; therfore are not to be reckoned, but accounted as out of the Church. But if we read it <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>the court that is without:</hi> as the <hi>kings edition,</hi> and <hi>the old verſion</hi> have it, then it ſignifies the place of the common people, into which alſo the Gentiles had acceſſe: <hi>by caſting forth</hi> whereof is ſignified, (as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay,) that onely the promiſcuous rabble of the Iewes &amp; hereticks following Antichriſt ſhould be <hi>caſt forth out of the Church, But</hi> we are to minde, how that <hi>court</hi> was before <hi>without the Temple:</hi> and how then could he bee commanded to <hi>caſt it forth?</hi> as if the common ſort onely, and not alſo kings, princes, and the rich men of the earth ſhould commit fornication with the whore. My <hi>Anonymus</hi> indeed retaines the <hi>vulgar reading:</hi> yet he rightly expounds it: THE COVRT THAT IS WITHOVT, IS THE TEMPLE, that is, <hi>Antichriſt &amp; his complices, who labour even before the doores of the Church to maintaine their avarice &amp; vaine oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of dignity: alſo falſe Chriſtians &amp; notorious or manifest tranſgreſſours in their places, who in words faine themſelves to bee the Church, but indeeds deny it:</hi> CAST FORTH: <hi>that is, inſinuate them to be cast out of the fellowſhip of the faithfull.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding the other <hi>reading</hi> is rather to be approved off, viz. the <hi>court within:</hi> as the moſt exact copies both greater &amp; leſſer of <hi>Robert Stephanus</hi> imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at <hi>Paris</hi> have it: And ſo <hi>Luther</hi> alſo renders it. This was the <hi>court of the Prieſts,</hi> in imitation whereof the <hi>Popiſh Temples</hi> have an inward <hi>Chore</hi> hallowed for the <hi>ſingers &amp; Maſsprieſts:</hi> into which the <hi>Laity</hi> is hardly allowed to looke through the Lattice. The meaning therfore of the propheſie is cleare, viz. that the <hi>clergie</hi> which appropriate the inward parts of temples to themſelves, ſhall fall away from the faith, &amp; have their ſhare with Antichriſt: &amp; therfore to be utterly rooted out of the Church of Chriſt. And this is that which <hi>John</hi> is commanded to propheſie, by this ſaying,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Hoſe.</hi> 1.1.</note> 
                        <hi>caſt forth,</hi> that is, <hi>declare that the court of Apoſtated prieſts ſhalbe caſt out:</hi> like as it was ſaid to Hoſea: <hi>Take unto thee a wife of whordomes,</hi> for, <hi>preach that this people is as a wife of whoredomes,</hi> &amp;c. But when doth he ſay, that it ſhal come to paſſe, &amp; wherefore? both will appeare by the reaſon annexed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For it is given unto the Gentiles</hi>] It now followes in the third place wherfore &amp; when the <hi>inward court ſhould bee caſt forth: becauſe it is given unto the Gentiles,</hi> that is, becauſe it is poſſeſſed and polluted by Antichriſtian prieſts, aliens from the Church of God. It was lawfull for the Gentiles to come into the <hi>outward court:</hi> but not into the inward. And therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was evillie handled by the furious Iewes,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Act.</hi> 21.28</note> becauſe they ſuppoſed he had defiled the <hi>holy place</hi> by bringing Greeks into the Temple. Hence the reaſon is plaine, why it is ſaid, that the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward court ſhould be caſt forth:</hi> namely becauſe it was ſo polluted by the prophane
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:96676:132"/>
                        <hi>idols</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> as that it was turned (though formerly ſet apart for holy uſes) into a neſt of devils, and den of theeves: &amp; ſo deſerved to bee caſt forth of the temple of God, &amp; troden as it were under foot by ſwine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is given</hi>] Without doubt by God:
<note place="margin">Who the Gentiles holding the inward court are.</note> by whoſe juſt indignation the Gentiles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded the ſame. But what <hi>Gentiles?</hi> this I have already ſhewed. They who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that <hi>the Gentiles</hi> are here properly meant, are indeed ſo intangled, as that they can neither ſhew who they are, nor when, or how they did, or ſhall poſſeſſe this court. They come nearer to the mark who underſtand it of Antichriſt &amp; his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, for it is manifeſt that here &amp; in the following ſentence is noted the time of Antichriſt. <hi>Ribera</hi> therfore ſaith wel: <hi>It is given to the Gentiles, that is, it ſhall be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained &amp; poſſeſſed by Antichriſt &amp; his miniſters, &amp;c. becauſe Antichriſts armie ſhall tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie conſiſt of heatheniſh men, worſhipping not the true God, but Antichriſt.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

Rom.</hi> 3.29</note> But the good man in the mean time ſees not, that it makes againſt their fiction, that Antichriſt ſhould be a Iew: for in ſcripture the Gentiles are continually oppoſed to the Iews: <hi>Is he the God of the Iewes onely, &amp; not of Gentiles alſo?</hi> I therefore take this ſenſe to be right, namely that theſe Gentiles ſhalbe Antichriſt &amp; his miniſters.</p>
                     <p>And hence it followes, that the <hi>prieſtlie court ſhall therefore be caſt forth out of the Church,</hi> becauſe the Clergy ſhall become heatheniſh, or degenerate unto paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme: not indeed by open profeſſion, but by their coulerable idolatrie &amp; heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh life. For they have turned the doctrine of faith, into heatheniſh philoſophie, teaching that men are juſtified by good workes: &amp; have brought the <hi>idols of the heathens,</hi> their names only being changed, into the Church of God, making of <hi>Juno, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enus, Pallas, Minerva, Diana, Proſerpina, Ceres, Bellona, Hecate, Rhamnuſia &amp; Iſis the queen of heaven:</hi> ſo many <hi>Maries:</hi> of <hi>Jupiter</hi> God the father: of <hi>Mars</hi> their <hi>S. George: Mercurie, Peter:</hi> of <hi>Neptune, Nicolas;</hi> &amp; ſo of other idols, their tutelar gods. The clergy alſo ſhal imitate the Gentiles, as well in their <hi>eccleſiaſtical order</hi> as common courſe of life. For after the man<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>er of the heathens, they have for their <hi>Archflamins,</hi> high prieſts, for their <hi>flamins,</hi> prieſts &amp; other orders, unto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they forbid mariage, but permit them to wallow in whordom: And as the heathens had their feaſts of <hi>Baccus, Ceres, Pan:</hi> ſo theſe keep <hi>ſhrovetide, Rogation weeke,</hi> &amp; ſuch like feſtivities, having altered onely the names thereof. To be ſhort they have corrupted al Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom with heatheniſh rites, &amp; overthrown the Church. SO ANONYMVS: <hi>becauſe it is given to the nations, that is, becauſe they ſhalbe like to unbeleevers, yea worſe then they: for it had been beteer for them not to have known the way of righteouſneſſe, then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have known it, to turn from the holy commandement delivered unto them,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. But that which followes doth expreſſe the thing more clearly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The holie city ſhall they tread under foot fourty &amp; two moneths</hi>] He declares by an <hi>auxeſis</hi> or amplification how the <hi>court is given:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay,
<note place="margin">The holy city troden under foot by the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles is the Church.</note> 
                        <hi>the court ſhall not onely be given unto the Gentiles, but all the holy citie alſo ſhall be troden under foot by them. Ribera</hi> againe rightly underſtands the <hi>holy citie</hi> to be the Church, typed out by Ieruſalem of old.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Moreover</hi> we are to obſerve, that the <hi>Angel,</hi> that is Chriſt who ſpeaketh theſe things, doth allude to his own words:
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.24.</note> 
                        <hi>Jeruſalem ſhalbe troden down by the Gentiles untill the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled:</hi> foreſhewing the beſieging, taking &amp; over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing of the city &amp; temple by the Romans; ſo that to <hi>tread under foot,</hi> is to fal upon, waſt &amp; deſtroy in a hoſtile manner, as was done unto Ieruſalem not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by <hi>Titus Veſpaſian.</hi> Now like as Ieruſalem was a type of the Chriſtian Church: ſo the treading down of Ieruſalem by the Romans, was a type that the Church alſo ſhould be troden under foote by the ſame nation. For <hi>Rome,</hi> as it was of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, ſo ſhal it be the calamity &amp; deſtruction of the Church. What ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be ſaid more clearly then this, that the Church ſhalbe poſſeſſed, troden down &amp; laid waſt by the <hi>Romiſh Antichrist</hi> &amp; his adherents. So then theſe words, viz. <hi>the Romaine Gentiles ſhall tread the holy citie under foot:</hi> agrees to that of the Apoſtle: <hi>The man of ſin</hi> (Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt) <hi>ſhall ſit in the temple of God:</hi> that is, he ſhall ſuppreſſe the Romiſh Church by tyranny, proudly boaſting himſelf to bee as <hi>God, the head &amp; univerſal monarch.</hi> But when, &amp; how long?</p>

                        <hi>Fourty and two moneths</hi>] here is wiſdome: It is manifeſt by the conſent al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of all interpreters, that the time of <hi>Antichriſts perſecution</hi> is hereby ſet forth. But what time &amp; how long it is to continue? or how to determine either of the beginning or ending thereof, is obſcure, both unto mee &amp; other interpreters: and happily it is beyond the reach of man. For it pleaſeth the ſpirit, that we ſhould rather ſtill be ſearching into ſome things which concerne the times, then certainly to know them: as Chriſt intimated unto his diſciples Act. 1.7. <hi>It is not for you to know the times and ſeaſons which the father hath put in his own power.</hi> However I will recite the chiefe opinions of learned men.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>first</hi> is of ſome Ancients, brought in by the authority of the Pope, which <hi>Caeſarienſis</hi> followeth, &amp; ſo doe generally al the Papiſts to this day, viz: that <hi>fourty two moneths,</hi> are <hi>aſtronomicall moneths,</hi> making <hi>three Aegyptian yeeres and an halfe:</hi> whence aroſe that received poopiſh opinion, that <hi>Antichrist ſhould onely reigne three yeeres and an halfe:</hi> This they collected out of <hi>Daniel</hi> Chap. 7.25. <hi>And they ſhalbe given into his hand untill a time, and times, &amp; the dividing of time.</hi> And Chap. 12.7. where the Angel ſweareth, <hi>that all theſe thinges ſhall bee finiſhed at a time, times &amp; halfe a time:</hi> The which diviſion of time is alſo aſſigned unto the Church baniſhed in the wilderneſſe, <hi>Reve.</hi> 12.14. of which we will ſpeake in its place: Now they make the <hi>three yeeres &amp; an half</hi> to bee the time immediatelie going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the end of the world,

II. And ſo conſequently the Pope of Rome is not he.

                        <hi>For Antichrist</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bellarmin</hi> in his V: demonſtration) <hi>ſhall onely reigne three yeeres, and an halfe: But the Pope hath already ſpiritually reigned in the Church, above fifteen hundred yeeres: and more then five hundred temporally: neither can any one be noted or accounted to be Antichriſt, unleſſe he hath preciſely reigned three yeeres, and an half. Therefore the Pope is not Antichriſt, neither is he as yet come.</hi>

                        <hi>But</hi> (to ſpeak nothing of the moſt falſe aſſumption of this ridiculous demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration) it is certaine, that the <hi>Romane Biſhops</hi> before <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time, were ſo far from <hi>raigning</hi> ſpiritually, much leſſe temporally in the Church, as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary they all ſuffered martyrdom for the ſake of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>True it is Sylveſters ſucceſſours many times affected <hi>the primacy,</hi> but were continually ſuppreſſed by their fellow Biſhops: untill that <hi>Boniface the third</hi> (many labouring, but in vaine, to hinder it) was by the authority of <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas</hi> the Emperour ſet on the chaire of <hi>univerſall peſtilence.</hi>

                           <hi>The fiction of the</hi> 42 <hi>aſtronomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal moneths refuted.</hi>
                        </note> To let theſe things (I ſay) paſſe for the preſent: the <hi>propoſition,</hi> which is taken from this place of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> is altogether falſe: becauſe that Popiſh opinion touching <hi>the</hi> 42 <hi>aſtronomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call moneths</hi> of Antichriſtian perſecution, is contradictorie both to it ſelf and the holy ſcriptures.</p>
                     <p>It conſiſts not with its ſelf, becauſe the things which they faine that their <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt</hi> ſhall effect, are as impoſſible to be don <hi>in the ſpace of three yeeres and a halfe,</hi> as for a ſnaile in three dayes to creep over the whole earth: he muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the Iewiſh nation diſperſed throughout the earth, for the Meſſias: he muſt ſit in the temple of Ieruſalem, which for ſo many ages hath lyen waſt under a horrible deſtruction: moreover he muſt kill three kings of Egypt, Lybia and Ethiopia, and ſubdue ſeven other princes: he muſt repaire the ruins of <hi>Rome</hi> burnt by thoſe ten kings, and chaſing <hi>the Pope</hi> from thence, ſit there as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch: perſecute and blot Chriſtian religion quite out of the world, to be ſhort bring the Church and the Empire of the whole world under him, &amp;c. Who, I pray you, except he were a mad man, would imagine that all theſe things ſhould bee poſſibly accompliſhed in four whole yeeres? What for meſſengers thinke ye ſhall Antichriſt have to ſend abroad, who ſo ſuddenly ſhall tell and perſwade the Iewes diſperſed over the face of the whole earth, of the comming of their Meſſias? The temple forſooth ſhall be built againe in three dayes, the which <hi>Solomon,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:96676:133"/>all manner of materials prepared to his hand, could not finiſh in ſeven yeeres, nor <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> ſcarſly rebuild in fourty ſix yeeres. Yea this Antichriſt, hardly of four yeeres ſtanding, ſhall expell the <hi>Turk</hi> out of <hi>Syria,</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> out of the Eaſt, <hi>Cham</hi> out of the South, &amp; <hi>Preſter John</hi> out of all the North.

                     <p>It is alſo diverſe wayes repugnant to the holie Scriptures.

                     <p>To be ſhort this onely ſufficeth, that in <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.5. theſe 42 <hi>moneths</hi> are againe repeated touching the <hi>beaſt, unto him power was given to continue fourty &amp; two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths:</hi> which cannot in any wiſe be underſtood of <hi>Aſtronomicall moneths,</hi> or <hi>three yeeres and an halfe.</hi> For that <hi>beaſt</hi> to Bellarmin, Alcaſar and others not a few, is the <hi>Romane Empire,</hi> the <hi>power</hi> whereof (whither it be taken of the old or new) conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued far longer then <hi>three yeeres and an halfe.</hi>

                     <p>For <hi>firſt as concerning</hi> the life of Chriſt,

                        </note> I rather thinke with <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> that he lived 32 complete yeeres and 74 <hi>dayes,</hi> then 34 yeeres, of which I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſomthing otherwere. So then the end of theſe yeeres would come ſhort of <hi>Boniface</hi> VIII.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondlie,</hi> it ſufficiently appeareth by what we have ſpoken on Chap. 4.1. <hi>I will ſhew thee things which muſt bee hereafter,</hi> that this account muſt not begin from Chriſts paſſion, or any other time before this viſion was exhibited unto <hi>John:</hi> And therefore theſe yeeres are to begin after the Revelation, &amp; ſo after the times of <hi>Domitian.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> although <hi>Boniface</hi> indeed moſt wickedlie <hi>trode under foot the holy city:</hi> yet after him it ceaſed not: for his ſucceſſours no way inferiour to him in Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian tyrannie, have gone foreward treading down the Church unto this day: Now it is apparent that here is noted the time, how long the <hi>holy city muſt be troden under foot by Antichriſtian Gentiles.</hi> So that theſe XLII <hi>moneths</hi> ſhal not be ended, untill the <hi>holie city</hi> be freed from this treading down. And therefore this opinion alſo ſeems to have little ſoliditie in it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>third,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The third opinion touching Sabbath-moneths.</note> is <hi>John Fox</hi> (that excellent writer of the <hi>Engliſh booke of Martyrs</hi>) in his conjectures on the Revelation, who underſtands the XLII <hi>moneths of ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, weekes, or yeeres,</hi> of ſo many times ſeven yeeres, which make 294. and ſo many yeeres he reckons from the death of Iohn Baptiſt unto Conſtantine the Emperour, under whom the Chriſtians firſt were freed from perſecution: <hi>as therefore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the times of the firſt perſecution of Chriſtians under the Jewes and Emperours increaſed unto</hi> 294 <hi>yeeres: ſo likewiſe the laſt perſecution, &amp; treading down of the holie citie, ſhall endure</hi> 294 <hi>yeeres, beginning from the time that the power of the Turkes firſt began to increaſe,</hi> viz. <hi>from the yeere of our Lord</hi> 1300. So theſe moneths ſhould have been ended in the yeere of Chriſt 1586. and the <hi>holy citie</hi> now delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from beeing <hi>troden under foot by the Gentiles</hi> more then 50 <hi>yeeres.</hi> Now how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I doe not at all derogate from this opinion, as beeing indeed verie pithy and ingenious: yet I ſcarſlie dare follow it.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>first,</hi> the hypotheſis or argument propounded touching the <hi>Sabbath-moneths,</hi> ſeems to be very uncertain, neither can it eaſily be proved by any example of Scripture where <hi>a moneth is put for a weeke of yeeres.</hi> The which alſo that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent divine of great Brittaine <hi>Robert Abbad</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Sarum</hi> (whom I name for honours ſake) ſeems clearly to prove,

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondlie,</hi> it appeareth plainely that this propheſie is not to be underſtood of <hi>treading down the holie citie by the Turkes,</hi> becauſe <hi>two witneſſes</hi> are brought in propheſying againſt that treading down: whereas <hi>propheſies</hi> will little help againſt Turkiſh tyrannie: courage &amp; force of armes rather muſt free the holy city from that oppreſſion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdlie,</hi> it is verie unlikely (according to his opinion) that the XLII
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:96676:134"/>42 <hi>moneths,</hi> ſhould now be finiſhed and the <hi>holie city</hi> ceaſe to be <hi>troden down by the Gentiles:</hi> For both in the Eaſt, &amp; Weſt a miſerable deſolation of the <hi>holy city</hi> is yet to bee ſeen. For the <hi>Turkes power</hi> is ſo far from beeing broken, as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary it dayly increaſeth, and ſets more &amp; more his feet upon the <hi>holy citie.</hi> The Romiſh tyrannie alſo, although it bee greatly weakned by <hi>the propheſie of the two witneſſes:</hi> not withſtanding it is not as yet broken, but ſtill oppreſſeth the Church both in the Weſtern and Northern kingdomes. I therefore leave the conjecture of this moſt learned man in the ſame nature, as he himſelf deſireth, <hi>I (ſaith hee) doe not at all aſſume this to my ſelf, to define here any thing on a certainty, or that my opinion ſhould be any way praejudicatorie unto others far better then my ſelf: this onely I deſire, that the ſame liberty which others take unto themſelves, may alſo bee granted to mee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence.</hi>

                     <p>In <hi>Alcaſars</hi> opinion I finde nothing eyther probable or true,

                     </p>
                     <p>In which two things are to be gathered: <hi>Firſt,</hi> that this place ſerves not at all for to eſtabliſh the common opinion of <hi>Antichriſts reigning for three yeeres and a halfe:</hi> whereas the Patrones thereof doe hence chiefly build upon. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that our interpreters who take not the <hi>numbers of dayes, moneths or yeeres,</hi> according to the letter, but underſtand them eyther of <hi>Sabbath-moneths,</hi> or <hi>propheticall dayes</hi> definite or indefinite,

                        <hi>Bullinger</hi> therefore &amp; moſt of our interpreters, conſidering that the method and drift of this propheſy is chiefly, to enlighten us ſomewhat in the future events of the Church, but not that we ſhould dare define preciſely the moments &amp; ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <hi>which the father hath ſet in his owne power,</hi> doe thinke, that a certaine deſigned time indeed of Antichriſtian perſecution is noted, yet left unto us uncertaine ſo far as concernes the termes, to wit, all that which is reckoned from thoſe fatall 666 <hi>yeeres</hi> mentioned <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. unto the laſt judgement.

The <hi>other,</hi> becauſe Daniel, Chriſt our Lord, &amp; Paul the Apoſtle, doe joyntlie teach us, that Antichriſts perſecution ſhall endure unto the day of judgement: the yeere or day wherof no man can certainlie determine.

But becauſe it remaines to us indefinite, that is, we cannot at the preſent determine of the certaine time: It is circumſcribed by a few moneths, that the faithfull in their tribulations might bee encouraged unto patience, knowing that their troubles ſhall not continue overlong, but as it were onely for a few moneths. Againe it is

                        <hi>They ſay,</hi> that the ſcripture doth never put a finite number for an indefinite: but the contrarie appeares by Iacobs ſpeach to Laban: <hi>Thou haſt changed my wages ten times:</hi> And Solomon: <hi>The just man falleth ſeven times.</hi> And Chriſt: <hi>Thou ſhalt forgive thy brother not ſeven times onely, but ſeventy times ſeven,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>They ſay in other places of this booke an uncertaine number is not put for a certaine: as Chap. 12.6. <hi>The woman ſhallbe in the wildernes</hi> 1260 <hi>dayes.</hi> And Chap. 13.5. <hi>The beaſt ſhall rage</hi> XLII <hi>moneths:</hi> And Chap. 20. <hi>Satan ſhallbe bound a</hi> 1000 <hi>yeeres.</hi> So in Ieremie 29.10. <hi>After</hi> 70 <hi>yeeres ye ſhall returne out of Babylon.</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo the number in this place is not uncertaine.

                     <p>Yet if I durſt ſpeake any thing touching the certaine beginning of theſe 42. <hi>moneths,</hi> I would (as moſt doe) by a propheticall myſterie applie them to 1260 <hi>yeeres</hi> beginning from the time that the holy city began to be troden under foot by the Romane Gentiles, not the old, but new, that is, by <hi>Antichristian Popes,</hi> whom we have ſhewed to be here noted by the Gentiles.

Then the <hi>ſtar</hi> of the Church of Rome, fallen from heaven upon the earth, opening the bottomleſſe pit, brought forth out of the <hi>ſmoke</hi> thoſe mortal <hi>Locuſts,</hi> ſpoken of Chap. 9. From the yeere of Chriſt therefore 606, untill this time the <hi>holy citie</hi> hath been troden under foot by the <hi>Romane Gentiles,</hi> which is the ſpace of 1073. yeeres, and is yet to be tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den down 223 yeeres more, to wit, untill the yeere of Chriſt 1866.

Wherefore I will determine nothing of theſe <hi>fourty and two moneths.</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. <hi>And I will give to my two witneſſes</hi>] I have expounded the <hi>generall propheſie</hi> touching the future reformation of the Church, after that the Companie of prieſts were departed from the faith unto paganiſme, and Antichriſt had <hi>troden downe the holy city</hi> by his tyranny. Now followes the <hi>ſpeciall propheſie</hi> touching the inſtruments, manner, ſucceſſe and event of this reformation: ſerving for the comfort of the faithfull: for when in appearance Antichriſt ſhall have wholy <hi>troden the holy city under foot,</hi> and thruſt Chriſt (as it were) out of all his poſſeſſion, then he will ſhew, that he ruleth in the midſt of Antichriſts kingdome, and will renew &amp; preſerve unto himſelf, a meaſured Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple <hi>in the city troden under foot,</hi> viz. <hi>by the propheſie of his two witneſſes.</hi> Now this part of the <hi>propheſie,</hi> is alſo full of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie,

                        <hi>I will give to my two witneſſes</hi>] He neither names the witneſſes, nor expreſſeth what he will give them. Some therefore geſſe one thing, and ſome another.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Beza</hi> here adds <hi>the ſame,</hi> to wit, the <hi>holie city,</hi> which agrees well with the ſenſe, becauſe Chriſt will truelie give, that is recommend the ſame unto <hi>his witneſſes,</hi> that ſo it may be ſet free from oppreſſion, and purged from the <hi>fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſmoake of Antichrist.</hi> Others: <hi>I will give them,</hi> to wit, <hi>a mouth and wiſedome,</hi> which Antichriſt ſhall not be able to reſiſt, according to that in Luke 21.15. <hi>I will give you a mouth and wiſedome, which all your adverſaries ſhall not be able to gainſay or reſist.</hi> Which promiſe is made to all faithfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours of the name of Chriſt. Others: <hi>I will give them,</hi> to wit <hi>my ſpirit,</hi> which is all one with the former: but it ſeems rather that the two future verbes are coupled together as noting the end and effect, <hi>I will give to them, and they ſhall propheſie,</hi> for, I will give unto them that they may propheſie, that is, authoritie or power to propheſie; and ſomuch ſuch coupling of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſignifies, as Gen. 34.30. <hi>They ſhall gather themſelves together against me, and ſmite me, and I ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi> For, that they may ſmite me, and I, and my houſe ſhall be deſtroyed.

                     </p>
                     <p>But concerning theſe <hi>witneſſes,</hi> who they are, and what time was determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for their propheſying: is a difficult queſtion. I will briefly ſpeak ſomewhat of it.</p>
                     <p>The Papiſts, taking the whole literallie, doe vainly dream,
<note place="margin">The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts fable about the two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</note> that when the Iewes with their <hi>leader Antichriſt,</hi> ſhall have recovered the citie of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> then theſe <hi>two witneſſes</hi> ſhall be preſent, who by propheſying ſhall oppoſe themſelves againſt theſe perfidious Iewes and Antichriſt 1260 <hi>dayes,</hi> that is, <hi>three yeeres and an halfe:</hi> The <hi>witneſſes</hi> they ſay, are <hi>Enoch and Elias,</hi> whom they affirme to be yet alive in paradiſe, and there reſerved to this end, that returning into the world they may reſiſt Antichriſt: But beeing ſlaine by him, they ſhall againe be reſtored to life after three dayes and an half, at the beholding of which miracle, the Iewes, (as they faine) ſhall turne to Chriſt and put Antichriſt to death in <hi>mount Olivet,</hi> and thenceforward prepare themſelves for Chriſt who ſhould now come fourty and five dayes after.</p>
                     <p>From this fable <hi>Bellarmin</hi> drew his third demonſtration in defence of the <hi>Pope,</hi> that he is not Antichriſt, neyther that Antichriſt is yet come: <hi>becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the two Prophets Henoch and Elias muſt come before Chriſt: but theſe are not as yet come, whereas the Pope of Rome hath now reigned for many ages: Therfore he is not the Antichriſt, neither is Antichriſt as yet come.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>major</hi> of this fable he laboureth to prove, <hi>first,</hi> by foure places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Malach. 4.5. <hi>Behold, I will ſend the prophet Elias,</hi> &amp;c. Eccluſ. 48.10. <hi>Elias is written in the judgements of times to pacific the wrath of the Lord and reſtore the tribes
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:96676:136"/>of Iſrael. And</hi> 44.16. <hi>Enoch was tranſlated into Paradiſe that he might give repentance unto the Gentiles</hi> Matt. 17.11. <hi>Helias ſhall come, &amp; reſtore all things.</hi> And Rev. 11.3. <hi>I will give to my two witneſſes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> by the authoritie of Fathers, as, <hi>Hilarie, Hierom, Origen, Chriſoſtom, Lactantius and Austin,</hi> who affirm that the <hi>two witneſſes are Henoch and Elias</hi> who ſhall come againſt Antichriſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdlie,</hi> by reaſon, becauſe otherwiſe a reaſon cannot be given, why theſe two were taken up before their death, and yet live a mortall life, and muſt dy at an appointed time.</p>
                     <p>But verely that in Luk.
<note place="margin">The Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical fable refuted.</note> 16.29. doth plainely contradict this <hi>fable,</hi> for Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham ſhewes that none are to be exſpected to come from heaven and preach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world: but that <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets are to be heard. This whole text alſo, touching the martyrdom of the two witneſſes, with the events that follow therupon doth ſtrongly make againſt this fiction. For how unlikely is it, that thoſe <hi>two holy men,</hi> who were taken up into heaven, &amp; live with God, ſhould againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into this mortal life, to be cruelly murdered by the <hi>beaſt?</hi> And how ſhould it be that their <hi>carkeiſes lying in the ſtreets of the great city, ſhould be ſeen in the ſpace of three dayes &amp; a halfe, of all peoples, nations, tribes &amp; tongues?</hi> what ſhal all the whole world in ſo ſhort a time flie like Eagles to Ieruſalem, to behold two carkeiſes? And how ſhall they all rejoyce &amp; ſend gifts to each other in three dayes time? How can two onely, within <hi>fourty two moneths,</hi> by their propheſie torment the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the whole earth? certainly the thing it ſelf ſpeaketh that this place cannot, nor ought to be underſtood according to the Letter. And therefore there is ſome other myſterie in it, which <hi>Hierom</hi> ſeeing, thus writes in <hi>Epist.</hi> 46. to MAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CELLA, <hi>if</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we follow the litteral interpretation, then we must rest in the Jewiſh fables, that Jeruſalem ſhalbe built again, and ſacrifices offered in the temple, to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of ſpiritual worſhip, and ſtrengthening of carnal ceremonies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To the <hi>first,</hi> I anſwer that the ſcriptures alledged, make nothing at all for the matter.
<note place="margin">Bellarmins arguments anſwered.</note> For the propheſie of <hi>Malachie</hi> ſpeakes not of a returne of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias out of Paradiſe,</hi> but of <hi>John the Baptists</hi> preaching in the power and ſpirit of Elias, for ſo the Angel interprets it to <hi>Zacharie,</hi> Luk. 1.17. <hi>He ſhall goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in the ſpirit and power of Elias, to turn the harts of the fathers to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> &amp;c. So Chriſt himſelf ſpeaking of <hi>John, Matt.</hi> 11.14. ſaith, <hi>If yee will receive it, hee is Elias which was to come,</hi> namely, according to the propheſie in <hi>Malach.</hi> 4.5. teaching us, how that propheſie was fulfilled in <hi>Iohn the Baptiſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bellarmin</hi> inſiſts on the contrarie, that <hi>Elias</hi> is to come before Chriſts laſt comming: For it is ſaid: <hi>I ſend him, before that great and terrible day of the Lord ſhall come.</hi> But this is not of neceſſity to be underſtood of the laſt day of judgement, becauſe the firſt comming of Chriſt was alſo great, by the myſterie of his incarnation and miracles: and terrible to the wicked, witneſſe <hi>Herods</hi> and the Iewes trembling. But be it granted, that <hi>Elias</hi> ſhall alſo come before the laſt day. Yet <hi>Malachie</hi> ſaith not that he ſhall preciſely come <hi>three yeeres &amp; an half</hi> before the judgement.</p>
                     <p>The former place of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> makes leſſe for the fable, both becauſe it is <hi>aprocrypha</hi> (and ſo proves nothing) as alſo becauſe the Latine reading is faultie as differing from all Greek copies. Of <hi>Elias</hi> it is ſaid Chap. 48.10. <hi>Thou art writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for reproofes in times, to pacifie the anger of Gods judgement in wrath: to turn the heart of the father to the child, and reſtore the tribes of Iſrael:</hi> The which things he is ſaid to have done not after his tranſlation into heaven, (of which it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth afterward in verſ. 13.) but in the time of his propheſying on earth.</p>
                     <p>The other place of <hi>Eccluſ.</hi> 44.16. is thus in Greek: <hi>Henoch pleaſed the Lord, and was tranſlated, beeing appointed an example of repentance unto the Nations:</hi> But the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:96676:136"/>
                        <hi>old verſion</hi> thus renders it falſly, <hi>that he might give repentance unto the nations.</hi> Now while he lived he was an example of repentance unto thoſe of his time.</p>
                     <p>The place of <hi>Matt.</hi> 17.11. doth manifeſtly ſpeak of the Baptiſt: For Chriſt there plainlie affirmes that <hi>Elias</hi> was alreadie come, to wit, the <hi>Baptist,</hi> whom they acknowledged not, but put to death. That which goes before: <hi>Elias in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſhall first come, and reſtore all things,</hi> doth not make any thing for the fable, but the place confirmeth <hi>Malachies</hi> propheſie, that is, as Elias was certainlie to come, ſo now he was already come, and that the ſame propheſie was fulfilled in the Baptiſt. It was the opinion of the <hi>Scribes,</hi> that <hi>Elias the Theſbite</hi> ſhould come before the Meſſias: who becauſe he was not as yet then come, therefore they <hi>denied Christ to be Meſſias. But</hi> Chriſt declares the falſe hood of their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, becauſe not <hi>Elias the Theſbite,</hi> but <hi>John the Baptist,</hi> was propheſied of by <hi>Malachie.</hi> But the Baptiſt did not reſtore all things: how then is he Elias? yea but he did reſtore all things according to the limitation of Malachie, and the Angel in <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. For <hi>he prepared the way of the Lord, &amp; turned the hearts of the fathers unto the children,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The opinion of the Fathers without the ſcriptures, proves nothing: neither do the fathers agree in one: ſome will have the <hi>two witneſſes to be Elias and Henoch:</hi> Others <hi>Elias &amp; Eliſha:</hi> Others <hi>Elias &amp; Moſes:</hi> Others <hi>Moſes and Aaron,</hi> becauſe they turned the waters into blood: Others <hi>Elias and Jeremie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now if any deſire to know more of the diſſentions both of the old and latter writers about theſe witneſſes,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Veſtigat. p.</hi> 578.</note> he may read in <hi>Alcaſar</hi> foure wayes of opinions: The FIRST <hi>way,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is interpreted of two men beeing to preach in Antichriſts time. The</hi> SECOND, <hi>of Antichriſts time indeed, but not of two men. The</hi> THIRD <hi>of two men, but not of Antichriſts time. To be ſhort the fourth neyther of two men, nor of Antichriſts time. Againe every of theſe wayes are devided as it were, into diverſe diviſions of Pathes:</hi> and other things there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. <hi>Hee himſelf</hi> goes in the fourth way, the worſt and falſeſt of all, The <hi>two witneſſes</hi> he makes to be two great vertues, WISDOM and HOLINESSE, as preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Goſpel in the primitive Church againſt the Iewes: which new opinion needs no refuting, ſeeing it is manifeſt that here mention is made not of <hi>qualities,</hi> but <hi>men</hi> preaching againſt the Beaſt or Antichriſt.</p>
                     <p>They, who will have theſe to be preciſely underſtood of <hi>two men,</hi> would have had more ſhew of reaſon, in applying the ſame to <hi>Iehoſhua</hi> &amp; <hi>Zerubbabel:</hi> ſeeing <hi>they two Zach.</hi> 4.3. are called <hi>two Olive-trees, &amp; two candleſticks,</hi> unto which theſe two witneſſes are here likened <hi>ver.</hi> 4.</p>
                     <p>To his reaſon, I anſwer, that it is falſe that no other cauſe can be given of the tranſlation of <hi>Henoch and Elias,</hi> without this fable. For they were taken up alive, that they might be examples to the world, how much the Lord ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of godlineſſe, and that there is another life prepared for the faithfull in heaven. Now to theſe two he vouchſaved this grace before others, becauſe he was better pleaſed with them then with others.</p>
                     <p>That <hi>Henoch and Elias</hi> ſhould yet live a mortal life &amp; be ſubject to death, is a verie fable. For how can they prove this fiction? And what mercie would there tranſlation into heaven be, if there they are reſerved unto a more cruel death? Wheras the Scripture teacheth, that to them who are eyther in paradiſe,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.26.</note> or in the place of torment, there is no going forth or returning. Paſſing by there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this fable, let us now goe foreward.</p>
                     <p>In Auſtins notes or the <hi>Revelation,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Whether the two witneſſes be the two teſtaments.</note> attributed to Triconius the <hi>two witneſſes</hi> are ſaid to be the <hi>old and new Teſtament:</hi> which <hi>Bede</hi> and <hi>Brightman</hi> follow, and ſome others of ours: as if the ſence ſhould be thus, notwithſtanding Antichriſts tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the ſcripture, yet God would give it power to <hi>propheſie,</hi> that is, reprove his tyranny, &amp; inſtruct the faithfull ſecretly mourning under the croſſe, in the way of life eternal. For the <hi>Scriptures are Gods witneſſes</hi> in the world againſt the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>ſearch the ſcriptures, for they teſtifie of me.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Io.</hi> 5.39.</note> Now thus far indeed
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:96676:137"/>it is true: But I ſee not how the following attributes (except it be by a harſh al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorie) can be applied unto the ſcriptures, viz. in that the <hi>witneſſes</hi> are ſaid <hi>to be clothed in ſackcloth, killed by the beast, their carkeiſes thrown in the ſtreets, reſtored to life and aſcend into heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are ſome, who thinke, that in the laſt times there ſhall come two moſt powerfull teachers, who being indued with the <hi>power and ſpirit of Elias,</hi> ſhal fulfill all theſe things literally, both by propheſying and fighting againſt Antichriſt. But they doe acknowledge, that this their opinion is uncertaine. And therefore in as much as I finde nothing certainely concluded touching this matter by others, and ſeeing the Lord for the preſent doth not ſuggeſt any thing unto mee, I wil follow the opinion of <hi>Bullinger,</hi> and ſome others of our beſt interpreters, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the <hi>two witneſſes</hi> indefinitely, to be diverſe reformers of religion in Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts times.</p>

But it is not credible, that Antichriſt ſending forth infinite <hi>Locuſts</hi> out of the ſmoke of hell into the Church, Chriſt ſhould raiſe up onely <hi>two witneſſes:</hi> beſides it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible (as we even now proved) that the things ſpoken of <hi>v.</hi> 9.10. ſhould be effected by two perſons alone. As for <hi>Bellarmins</hi> objections, we ſhall have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to examin them hereafter.</p>
                     <p>We therefore by theſe <hi>two witneſſes</hi> doe indefinitely underſtand, a ſucceſſion of certaine maintainers of Evangelical truthes againſt Antichriſt. Yet they are ſaid to be <hi>two</hi> definitely, <hi>both</hi> becauſe they are but few in reſpect of the <hi>Locusts,</hi> of whom the whole Chriſtian world are full: <hi>as</hi> alſo becauſe in all matters of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>two</hi> ſuffice to confirme a teſtimony, that ſo we might neither be deceived by the applauſe of the multitude of Locuſts, nor offended at the fewnes of ſincere teachers, wherewith Antichriſt upbraides us. Beſides in the laſt place, as of old, the Lord was pleaſed to uſe two witneſſes as inſtruments in his hand for ſpecial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances of the Church: Thus he ſent two, viz. <hi>Moſes and Aaron</hi> unto <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> for the deliverance of the Iſraelites out of Aegypt: <hi>Joſuah and Caleb</hi> to ſearch the promiſed land: <hi>Zerubbabel &amp; Jehoſhuah</hi> to bring back the people from Babylo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, unto which <hi>two</hi> there is here a plaine alluſion in verſ. 4. As theſe two latter (I ſay) ſufficed to deliver the people of God out of the firſt Babyloniſh and corporall captivity, ſo <hi>two,</hi> that is, few propheſying witneſſes, ſhall ſuffice to deliver the Church from the ſecond Babyloniſh &amp; ſpiritual captivity. And thus much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>two witneſſes.</hi> Now what doe they?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>They ſhall propheſie</hi>] to wit, <hi>againe</hi> according to the commandement: <hi>Thou muſt againe propheſie:</hi> We are not by <hi>propheſie,</hi> ſtrickly to underſtand a praediction of things to come: but in a larger ſenſe, for the preaching of Prophetical &amp; Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical doctrines, which were darkned, yea troden down by Antichriſt, but again renewed by their propheſying, that is, by faithfull preaching unto the Church: for <hi>Christ will give this unto them,</hi> that is, ſo arme them with an heroick ſpirit and qualifications, as that they ſhalbe able ſtrongly to oppoſe and ſhake Antichriſts kingdom, which ſeemed to be ſo eſtabliſhed throughout the Chriſtian world, as if it had been an invincible fortreſſe. But when, &amp; how long?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Two thouſand two hundred &amp; ſixtie dayes</hi>] This againe is hard to be underſtood: but we muſt looke back to what hath been treated of touching the <hi>fourty two moneths:</hi> for it is cleare enough, that by thoſe <hi>moneths,</hi> &amp; theſe <hi>dayes,</hi> one and the ſame time is deſigned.
<note place="margin">The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on touching theſe dayes refuted.</note> For <hi>fourty two</hi> equall moneths preciſely conſiſt of 1260 <hi>dayes:</hi> but herein is the difference, that the Papiſts reſtraine theſe moneths and theſe dayes aſtronomically unto <hi>three yeeres &amp; an half,</hi> which is the time their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Antichriſt ſhall reigne, and theſe <hi>witneſſes propheſie:</hi> but this cannot be, both becauſe the fable of Antichriſts ſtanding ſo ſhort a time, hath been before refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: as alſo becauſe it is contradictorie, that the time of Antichriſt and of <hi>the two witneſſes</hi> ſhould be of one continuance, &amp; yet Antichriſt ſhould ſlay the witneſſes after they had propheſied 1260 <hi>dayes,</hi> &amp; rejoyce thereat with his followers.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Why the moneths are changed into dayes.</note> We have nothing here to anſwer preciſely; except, that the ſame time, &amp; the ſame thing is ſet forth by diverſe expreſſions, as it is familiar with the prophets: By <hi>two dreames</hi> God ſignified the ſame thing unto <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> ſo generally throughout this whole propheſie, the ſame events are prefigured by diverſe types.

                     <p>Furthermore, what we ſaid before concerning the 42 <hi>moneths,</hi> ſeems here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to bee repeated of the 1260 dayes, &amp; it may be, to the end that the time both of the moneths and dayes might hereby be defined: For why ſhould the ſpirit of God rather attribute 42 moneths unto Antichriſts treading down, then 10, 20, 60 or 100? and why ſhould 1260 <hi>dayes</hi> be rather appointed then more or leſſe? If therefore it might be lawfull to geſſe at the termes of the <hi>moneths</hi> and <hi>yeeres</hi> from hiſtories paſt and preſent, then I ſhould thinke, that as Antichriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to tread down the Church, when <hi>Boniface the third</hi> was ſet on the Chaire of <hi>univerſal peſtilence, anno</hi> 606. and that the Church hath now from that time unto this been troden down 34 <hi>moneths, and an half:</hi> ſo the propheſie of <hi>the two witneſſes</hi> againſt Antichriſt hath continued 1036 <hi>dayes,</hi> and ſo are not yet ended.

                     <p>For it appeareth by hiſtories, that the Biſhops of <hi>France</hi> &amp; <hi>Germanie,</hi> yea alſo of <hi>Italie,</hi> but eſpecially they of <hi>Ravenna, Mediolanum</hi> and <hi>Aquileia,</hi> did often times moſt ſtronglie oppoſe the ſucceſſours of Pope <hi>Boniface:</hi> As alſo <hi>Synods</hi> not a few have condemned the tryannie and idols of the <hi>Popes of Rome:</hi> moreover among theſe <hi>witneſſes</hi> were <hi>John Scottis, Bertramus the Abbat, Berengarius</hi> a prieſt, <hi>Waldus</hi> in France, <hi>Wickleffe</hi> in England: as alſo <hi>Nicolaus Clemanges,</hi> &amp; <hi>Marſilius</hi> of <hi>Patavia.</hi> Beſides many of the Emperours (as <hi>Henry</hi> IV. &amp; V. <hi>Frederick</hi> I. &amp; II. <hi>Ludowick</hi> IV. &amp;c.) have with all their might ſuppreſſed Popiſh tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.

                        <hi>Clothed with ſackcloth</hi>] The firſt title declares their contemptible condition in the eyes of worldly men. <hi>Sackcloth</hi> was the habit of mourners, as the <hi>Ninevites,
<note place="margin">Title of the witnes is their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ttemptible habit.</note> Daniel, Mordecai,</hi> are ſaid to have mourned in ſackcloth. Chriſt ſpeaking of them <hi>of Tyre and Sidon,</hi> ſaith, <hi>that they would have repented in ſackcloth and aſhes.</hi> It was alſo the habit of the prophets, and now is of poore and deſpiſed men.</p>
                     <p>Some therefore by their wearing of ſackcloth will have the argument of their propheſie to be noted <hi>metaleptice:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Metalepſis is a figure, by which a word is put from its proper ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> becauſe they ſhall denounce unto the world mourning, and puniſhments at hand in regard of Antichriſts abominations: and are to call men unto repentance: And indeed rightly may it be thus taken: for their propheſie ſhall conſiſt in preaching of repentance.</p>
                     <p>Others interpret it of their own mourning, becauſe by their baſe and mean ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit they ſhall manifeſt the bitternes and griefe of their mind for the deſtruction of the Church and horrible blindneſſe of the world: even as ſuch in old time were in bitternes of ſpirit who cloathed themſelves in ſackcloth. This alſo may well ſtand.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding I rather take it of the neglected condition of the miniſters of the Goſpell. For <hi>ſackcloth</hi> undoubtedly is oppoſed to the pompe and luxurie &amp; Antichriſt, and his <hi>Locuſts:</hi> Theſe glorious praelates, with their ſoft, ſilken &amp; broidered garments of gold and ſilver bewitch the world: whereas on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie theſe <hi>witneſſes</hi> ſhalbe vile, and deſpiſed, ſcarſly having whereon to live or cloathe themſelves. And indeed allmoſt all the ſervants of Chriſt who hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to have waged warre with the Beaſt, have been abject, poor and deſpiſed in the eye of the world.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bellarmin</hi> upbraides us with this <hi>ſackcloth</hi> as beeing an argument of the falſitie of our religion, <hi>The Patrones of our opinon</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>have been great and worthie men, and followed by the whole world: but</hi> BERENGARIVS <hi>was a Deacon, a man neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and having for his followers a few poore Schollers.</hi> But for our parts wee need not be offended thereat: for how contemptuouſly ſoever the world judgeth thereof: yet the excellencie of the ſame before God we ſhall hear by &amp; by.</p>

<note place="margin">The digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the witneſſes.</note> They ſhall not bee therefore neglected of God becauſe the world deſpiſeth them: For they are <hi>two Olive-trees, &amp; candleſticks:</hi> wherby myſtically the dignitie of the miniſterie of the word is noted, as ſerving in ſtead of <hi>Olive-trees and candleſticks</hi> unto the Church.

A <hi>candleſtick</hi> beares up the light, by which darkneſſe is expelled, and the whole houſe enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: ſo the miniſterie of the witneſſes ſhalbe lively &amp; efficacious, becauſe the Oyle and anointing of the Spirit is powred forth through it on the elect. It is known, that the grace of the ſpirit is verie often compared unto Oile (eſpeciallie by Iohn) in regard of a like efficacie. Theſe witneſſes therefore ſhalbe <hi>Olive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees,</hi> powring forth by propheſy <hi>ſpirituall oyle,</hi> that is, they ſhall be profitable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments for the ſalvation of true beleevers.

                     <p>I ſaid before, that this is an alluſion unto the type <hi>Zach.</hi> 4.14. where God ſaith of Zerubbabel and Iehoſhua the two captaines that brought his people back againe: <hi>Theſe are the two ſons of oyle</hi> (or anointed ones) <hi>ſtanding before the ruler of the whole earth:</hi> by which commendatorie title the authority of theſe <hi>two,</hi> is ſet forth.

                        <note place="margin">The fable of the four yeeres re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</note> But this fable we have before refuted, &amp; here it is apparent, that it cannot conſiſt.

This alſo ſerves to prove, that Antichriſt ſhall have power indeed to kill &amp; overcome the <hi>witneſſes:</hi> but not their teſtimony in the leaſt: for it is ſaid, they ſhall accompliſh their teſtimonie: And therfore the preaching of the Goſpel ſhal endure unto the end.</p>
                     <p>Thus we ſee who the <hi>Beaſt</hi> is, &amp; what time is to bee underſtood. It remaines now to be handled what manner of warre it is, &amp; what the effect therof ſhalbe.</p>

                        <hi>First,</hi> by the ſeditious ſermons of the <hi>Locusts,</hi> their venemous writings and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtical diſputations in the behalfe of <hi>Apollyon</hi> againſt the witneſſes of Chriſt, branding them for moſt peſtilent hereticks: They ſhall preach with great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe to the multitude, that the <hi>Beast is head of the Church, Christs Vicar,</hi> and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as with the <hi>key of Peter,</hi> ſo with the <hi>ſword of Paul and Caeſar,</hi> crying out with full mouths, that his kingdom is <hi>the Catholick Church.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> through <hi>the Councils of Locusts,</hi> by whoſe decrees the <hi>Beast</hi> ſhall eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh his kingdom, and <hi>anathematize,</hi> as heretical, the truth of Chriſt. For it is true,

                     </p>
                     <p>To be ſhort by the <hi>bulles</hi> and <hi>excommunications</hi> of the <hi>Romiſh court,</hi> by which he ſhall condemne Chriſtes witneſſes with their teſtimony, for hereſie, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering them over to the ſecular power, deſtroy them by fire and ſword, to wit, as unworthy to breath or live in the world. Moreover the <hi>beast</hi> will raiſe up civill warres, and by his ſubtiltie cauſe the kingdomes and provinces of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world, to fight againſt the Goſpell, that ſo the witneſſes of Chriſt may bee overcom and killed. Therfore it followeth:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The beast ſhall overcome them, and kill them</hi>] The latter declares the former. This very thing doth ſufficientlie ſhew, that theſe <hi>witneſſes</hi> cannot be literallie taken for <hi>Enoch and Elias.</hi> For what godly man will beleeve, that thoſe holy prophets whome the ſcriptures teſtifie to have been tranflated from death to life eternal, ſhould again return into the earth, to be cruelly killed by Antichriſt?</p>
                     <p>Furthermore the <hi>Beaſt</hi> ſhall kill the witneſſes, in the like manner he overcame them, partly by <hi>eccleſiaſtical cenſure,</hi> partly by the <hi>ſecular ſword:</hi> ſo then not by the goodneſſe of his cauſe, nor by the holie ſcriptures (for by theſe the witneſſes ſhall overcome and conſume Antichriſt) but he ſhall overcome them by outward force and tyranny, by the <hi>authority of Councils,</hi> by thundring out his <hi>bulles,</hi> by cruel warre, and his hangmen. Thus, I ſay, he warreth againſt the Saintes, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coms &amp; kills them, not by arguments &amp; ſcriptures: but by ſword, fire &amp; excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications.</p>
                     <p>So alſo my <hi>Anonymus</hi> 260 yeers paſt, wrot concerning the Popes victorie: <hi>He ſhall overcome them in reputation of his friendes: &amp; kill them, ſome corporally, eyther by burning, or murdering them with the ſword, &amp; other kinds of death, others civilly by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judging them to perpetuall impriſonment: &amp; againſt theſe, whom he cannot torment in this manner, he will at leaſt thunder out his excommunications, inſomuch as they ſhall not be accounted otherwiſe then dead men in the Church, ſo far as concerneth a ſpiritual life.</hi> What would not this author have written, had he ſeen the hiſtories of our time, &amp; the foregoing age, when the Beaſt anathematized the two witneſſes of <hi>England: John Wickleffe</hi> that excellent teacher and oppoſer of Poperie (and his protectour <hi>John Earl of Leiceſtre,</hi>) whoſe carkeiſe not long after being taken up out of the grave he cauſed to be burnt: When he overcame, &amp; burnt (contrarie to the publick faith of the Empire) the two witneſſes of Bohemia, <hi>John Huſſe,</hi> and

                     <p>
                        <hi>And their carkeiſes</hi>] The particle, <hi>ſpirituallie,</hi> here mentioned, ſhewes that this alſo is not literallie to be underſtood, as we ſhall further ſee by that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.</p>
                     <p>The cruelty therefore of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> againſt the <hi>witneſses,</hi> falſly condemned for hereſie, is hereby noted: foraſmuch as they ſhall not be ſatiated by curſing and putting of them to death, but alſo inſult contumeliouſly over them after their death. All ſorts of injuries are here noted under this one, which for the kind of it is the moſt inhumane: namely, to hinder their carkeiſes (contrarie to the law of all nations) from beeing buried, but cauſing the ſame to be thrown forth unto the ſcorn of all in the <hi>ſtreetes of the great city.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>carkeiſes of the witneſses</hi> are not onely their bodies,
<note place="margin">What is meant by the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keiſes of the witneſſes.</note> unto which theſe things doe frequentlie happen according to the letter, (for the <hi>Beaſt</hi> wil not ſuffer any heretick to have Chriſtian buriall, as they call it) but alſo their names curſed by him, and bookes which he prohibits to be made uſe of, read, or ſold, but cauſeth them to be burnt, to be ſhort their families alſo which he ſeekes by all meanes to make infamous and to ſuppreſſe: So that to <hi>lie in the ſtreetes,</hi> is to be expoſed to the publick ſcorn of all men.

                        <hi>Sodom</hi>] Firſt <hi>Rome</hi> is called <hi>Sodom,</hi> not literally (for <hi>Sodom</hi> was now long agoe conſumed by fire from heaven) but <hi>spiritually,</hi> or <hi>myſtically,</hi> that is, allegoricallie,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:96676:142"/>and in a certain ſimilitude: for the word <hi>ſpiritually,</hi> is not here put in a <hi>Theological</hi> but <hi>Rhetorical</hi> ſenſe: And this is plain, becauſe to ſpeak <hi>Theologically,</hi> there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſpirituall in this city, except the bare name, as beeing called <hi>the holie city,</hi> &amp; <hi>Catholick Romane Church.

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>We diſtinguiſhed the ſame for methods ſake into four</hi> Acts. <hi>The firſt whereof Chap.</hi> 8.9, <hi>was a propoſition of the calamities of the Church under the ſounding of ſixe trumpets, that is, by Romane tyrants, until the time of</hi> Conſtantine, <hi>and from thence by hereticks and ambitious Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, unto</hi> Gregorie, <hi>and at length by the Weſterne Antichriſt the king of Locuſts, unto the council of Conſtans, as alſo by the Mahumetan tyranny, until the overthrow of the Eaſtern Empire, &amp; taking of</hi> Conſtantinople.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Act <hi>was contrarie to the former, as treating of the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:96676:143"/>during the whole time of the Churches afflictions, the which the godly ought to oppoſe unto their calamities, that they might not be diſcouraged in regard of the long continuance of the croſſe Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>The</hi> ſumme <hi>was: Iohn ſaw a mighty Angel deſcending from heaven, having a booke open in his hand, ſtanding with his right foot upon the ſea, &amp; his left upon the earth: cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a great voyce like a roaring Lyon, inſomuch as ſeven thunders ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered their voyces, lifting up his right hand to heaven, and ſwearing by the living God that the time of afflictions should be no more, but that even now at the ſounding of the ſeventh trumpet an end of labours, and the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the judgement of God were at hand, To be ſhort commanding Iohn to eat up the booke that was open, and againe to propheſie before the end. By all which things we are taught, that in the midſt of the rage of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and greateſt diſtreſſes of the godly, Chriſt doth deſcend from heaven, not leaving his Church as an orphant, but holding in his hand the open booke of his word, that it might not be altogether ſuppreſſed: ſets his feet upon the earth and ſea, that every where ſome remnants of the faithfull might be preſerved: By his Lionlike voyce he ſtirs up the thunders which utter their voyces, that is, ſome ſincere preachers oppoſing themſelves againſt Antichriſt, although their voyces remained ſealed, nor profited much for a ſeaſon: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms by oath the deliverance of the godly, and deſtruction of the wicked, that Antichriſts rage might not alwayes continew: To be ſhort, gives a command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Iohn to eat up the booke, &amp; againe to propheſy, that the godly might conſider that the groſſe darkneſſe of Antichriſts kingdom ſhould be expelled in theſe laſt times, the Church reformed, &amp; his tyranny diminished by propheſie renewed, as by a clear light breaking forth. This is the</hi> ſecond Act <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The</hi> third Act <hi>is an amplification of the calamities of the Church under Antichriſt: deſcribing new combats of the faithful with the Beaſt, their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, &amp; the clearing of doctrine, and a future reformation of the Church by the two witneſſes of Chriſt.

                        <hi>Now I have ſhewed before, that the</hi> third Act <hi>concerning the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church is propounded two manner of wayes:</hi> Firſt <hi>generally, where Iohn is commanded with a meaſuring reed to mete the temple of God, the altar, and the worſhippers therein: yet not to meaſure the inward court, but to caſt it forth, becauſe both it and the holy city alſo was given unto the</hi> Gentiles <hi>to be troaden under foot</hi> 42 <hi>moneths: In which we obſerved, that the meaſuring of the temple doth ſhadow out the repairing of the Church op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by Antichriſt, &amp; to be effected chiefly in the laſt times by the reed of Gods word: The which reformation the inward court or clergie ſhould not admit: as refuſing to bee meaſured: And therfore ſhould be caſt out, that is, declared not to appertaine unto the Church, becauſe Antichriſt hath troden down the ſame with more then heatheniſh idolatrie and tyrannie.</hi>

                        <hi>Touching the time of the</hi> XLII <hi>moneths I have ſhewed diverſe opinions of learned men about it: among which two may be received as moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable: by ſuppoſing each moneth to containe thirtie dayes, which make as in v.</hi> 3. 1260 (<hi>not aſtronomical but) prophetical daies, by reckoning a day for a yeere, as in Ezech.</hi> 4.6. <hi>And in this ſenſe the yeeres of Antichriſts trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding down the Church are</hi> 1260. <hi>But where to begin, or where to end them God knoweth: perhaps the time cannot be calculated &amp; defined by any man. Therfore moſt learned interpreters dare ſay nothing of certainty about this, for howſoever the time of this treading down be defined by the counſel of God: yet is not to be ſearched into by us</hi> a priori, <hi>nor known for the preſent. In this ſenſe they hold that the number of yeeres are definite in Gods decree &amp; as revealed to Iohn, but ſo far as concerneth us and our knowledge indefinite: for it is not for us to know the moments which the father hath kept in his own power.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Notwithſtanding if any thing were by us to be defined from hiſtories, then the time of this treading down began, when the Romiſh Antichriſt firſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted himſelf unto the world by ſtepping into the chaire of</hi> univerſal <hi>peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence under the Emperour Phocas anno</hi> 606. <hi>And in this ſenſe the treading down from that time unto this hath dured</hi> 1036 <hi>yeeres, two hundred twenty &amp; four yeeres yet remaining unto the end: But far bee it from us, that we ſhould dare pronounce any thing peremptorily of Gods ſecrets. Theſe things generally touching the meaſuring of the Church v.</hi> 1.2.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>the Churches reformation is more ſpecially declared, as by whom, how, with what ſucceſſe and event it ſhould be don.</hi>

                        <hi>The two witneſſes according to the common conceit are to be</hi> Enoch <hi>&amp;</hi> Elias, <hi>who ſhall deſcend from heaven, &amp; propheſie againſt Antichriſt, and be killed by him. But the vanitie of this Iewiſh fable hath been ſhewed by us.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>At laſt we conſented to that opinion as the moſt ſafe, by which the two witneſſes are partly definitely, &amp; partly indefinitely underſtood.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondlie</hi> two <hi>definitely: becauſe as God of old was wont to uſe the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie of</hi> two <hi>worthies in the execution of his ſingular and ſpecial workes, one of them commonly being a civill, the other an eccleſiaſtical perſon: Thus he ſent</hi> Moſes <hi>&amp;</hi> Aaron <hi>to Pharaoh:</hi> Ioſhua <hi>&amp;</hi> Caleb <hi>to ſpie the land:</hi> Elias <hi>&amp;</hi> Eliſha <hi>unto Ahab:</hi> Zerubbabel <hi>and</hi> Ioſhua <hi>to bring back the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of Babylon, &amp; to reſtore the worſhip &amp; temple of Ieruſalem, unto whom there is here a manifeſt alluſion in v.</hi> 4. <hi>ſo he raiſed up under Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:96676:144"/>for the moſt part two ſpeciall inſtruments among his witneſſes for the maintenance of his truth: as</hi> Iohn Huſſe <hi>&amp;</hi> Ierome of Prague, <hi>whom the Locuſts of the Councill of Conſtans moſt cruelly burnt againſt the publick faith: In our Fathers dayes</hi> Luther <hi>and</hi> Melanchthon <hi>in Saxonie: At Argentine</hi> Bucer <hi>and</hi> Cariton: <hi>In Helvetia</hi> Zwinglius <hi>and</hi> Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colampadius: <hi>In France</hi> Farellus <hi>and</hi> Calvin: <hi>and ſo others in other places.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Furthermore <hi>he deſcribed the power of the witneſſes by many excellent and wonderfull phraſes taken out of the hiſtorie of the chiefe prophets: viz. Their enemies that would hurt them, they ſhall devour by the fire of their mouth, as did</hi> Elias <hi>and</hi> Ieremie: <hi>ſhut heaven that it raine not for three yeeres and ſixe moneths, as did the ſaid</hi> Elias: <hi>Turn wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into blood, and ſmite the earth with all manner of plagues, as</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <hi>and</hi> Aaron <hi>ſmote Aegypt: by which allegories is ſignified, that at length the preaching of the Goſpell ſhould goe forth with ſuch force &amp; effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie as that no oppoſite power or threatnings ſhould be able to hinder the ſame.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>Notwithſtanding however they ſhall finish their teſtimony, yet they ſhall prevaile little againſt the Beaſt: for the Beaſt ſhall warre againſt them, overcome and kill them by drawing out both ſwords, as we have declared.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Neither ſhall the Beaſt be ſatiated by oppreſſing the witneſſes: but ſhall caſt forth their dead bodies as dung to the ſcorne of the common people into the ſtreetes of</hi> Rome, the great citie, <hi>which is ſpirituallie, that is, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorically called</hi> Sodome, <hi>becauſe of Sodomiticall filthineſſe reigning ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in:</hi> Aegypt, <hi>becauſe of their Aegyptian idolatrie, darkneſſe and obſtinacie againſt Chriſts ambaſſadours: and</hi> Ieruſalem <hi>becauſe of their wicked cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, daylie crucifying the Lord Ieſus Chriſt both in his members, as alſo (as much as in them is) deſtroying him now glorified in the heavens in their daylie ſacrifice of the</hi> Maſſe. <hi>Thus far we formerly went in our interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:96676:145"/>the ſtreetes,</hi> that is, publickely expoſed as doung to all manner of reproach. And the reaſon is given.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For they ſhall not ſuffer them to be put in graues</hi>] The which cruelty is contrarie to nature, and the Law of nations. But who will not ſuffer it? The <hi>Beast</hi> with his <hi>mitred Locusts</hi> and the reſt of his followers. As by their Councils may be ſeen. Now here one ſort of the worſt of contumelies is put for all kind of reproaches, which hitherto in the Papacie (as hiſtories teſtifie) have been fulfilled according to the letter. For according to Popiſh lawes, ſuch as are hereticks, may not be buried, as beeing unworthie to be covered with earth: but rather to be conſumed in flames of fire: And therfore <hi>anno</hi> 1387 <hi>the Councill of Conſtans</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that the bones of <hi>Wickleffe</hi> ſhould bee taken out of the grave 28 yeeres after his death, and burnt, that ſo the aſhes therof might lie unburied in the ſtreets. The ſaid Council would not permit the <hi>carkeiſes of the two witneſſes Huſſe</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> to be put in graves, but to be burned, &amp; the aſhes caſt into the River <hi>Rhijne:</hi> And the like cruelty the <hi>Beast</hi> hath exerciſed againſt infinite carkeiſes, writings, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies and eſtates of Martyrs.</p>
                     <p>That the bodies of <hi>Luther, Melanchthon,</hi> &amp; other witneſſes were not caſt forth in like maner, was not for any want of crueltie in the <hi>Beast.</hi> For had they fallen into his hands, they ſhould have had the like uſage. Now the ſpirit would not have us to be offended at this kinde of contumely: for it no way derogates from the ſalvation of the witneſſes: becauſe, <hi>precious in the eyes of the Lord, is the death of his gratious Saintes:</hi> and to be unburied is but a ſmall loſſe.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>And the inhabitants of the earth ſhall rejoyce</hi>] The madnes and fury of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtians is here ſhewed, with the cauſe thereof.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Inhabitants of the earth</hi>] Thus in way of contempt (as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.10.) he calleth worldly men, the ſworn vaſſals of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> the children of the earth, wholy given to worldly things. This is <hi>Antichriſts Catholick Church</hi> here upon earth. What ſhall they doe? They ſhall rejoyce over the dead bodies of the martyrs, and ſend preſents one to another in token of joy, as they uſe to doe in times of publick triumph and victorie. But this is an inhumane, not to ſay a diveliſh wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, for to rejoyce at anothers harme, and inſult over the afflicted. <hi>It is</hi> (ſaith Rupertus) <hi>a moſt foule ſin for wicked men to rejoyce in their evill, and ungodly actions.</hi> But wherat ſhall they laugh? even at their own wickednes, which is indeed <hi>madd mirth,</hi> and to be aſhamed of. During the <hi>Councill of Conſtans,</hi> were kept publick bankets and ſhowes at the burning of the martyrs, as if they had overcome their enemies. And to this day as often as the <hi>Locuſts</hi> condemn the Saintes unto the fire, they keep <hi>holy dayes</hi> (as they call them) and feaſtings, they ſing <hi>Te Deum Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus:</hi> and gratulate each other by ſending gyfts, and preſents one to another. We therefore ought not to be offended at this furious mirth of <hi>the Beaſt</hi> &amp; his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, but rather to be confirmed in the faith: for in this very thing, he doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly ſhew himſelf to be the great Antichriſt.</p>
                     <p>Now what is the cauſe of their joy? <hi>Becauſe theſe two prophets tormented the in inhabitants of the earth</hi>] This indeed Antichriſt pretends, as if the martyrs were juſtly put to death, deprived of Buriall, and burnt to aſhes, becauſe they were troubleſome by their preaching, diſturbers of the publick peace, guilty of <hi>crimen laeſae majeſtatis,</hi> blaſpheming God and the Saintes, and oppoſing the Catholick Church. But it is a lying pretence, for the Goſpell is the <hi>doctrine of peace,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Antichriſts falſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for his tyranny.</note> of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and life.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>witneſſes</hi> therefore labour by their doctrine to keepe the inhabitants of the earth from eternall torments, and to direct them into the way that leadeth to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ſalvation. Neither is it any fault in the <hi>witneſſes</hi> that the ungodly are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at the doctrine of Chriſt, pricked in their conſciences, tormented and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ontragious, but it is by their own malice: who, becauſe they love falſhood, hate the light, as ſuch which have ſore eyes cannot endure the brightneſſe of the ſunne. The Goſpell therefore torments the wicked by accident, For in its ſelf it comforts, &amp; makes glad the hearts of the faithfull.</p>

                        <pb n="242" facs="tcp:96676:146"/>
Hence we learn, that it is the propertie of Antichriſtians, falſly to impute that unto the <hi>witneſſes of the truth,</hi> which is proper unto themſelves: For it ſaid is in Chap. 9.5. <hi>It was given to the Locuſts not to kill but torment men:</hi> ſo then it is the proper worke of the <hi>Locuſts</hi> to torment and vexe the conſcience by their deceits: And yet they are not aſhamed falſely to accuſe the witneſſes of Chriſt, as if they tormented the ſons of men.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. <hi>But after three dayes</hi>] We have heard the martyrdome of the witneſſes, and the triumph of Antichriſtians thereat. Now let us heare the <hi>cataſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe</hi> or change. The <hi>witneſſes</hi> that were ſlaine are delivered and reſtored to life and glorie: the adverſaries amazed, tremble and periſh. Which ſerves to comfort us againſt Antichriſts crueltie: conſidering that unto us a certaine delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is here ſhewed, but confuſion to the adverſaries. Let us therfore patiently ſuffer his tyrannie, for it ſhal neither dure long, nor hinder our ſalvation. For being overcome we conquer.

Now to the ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>The Papiſts take it for the miraculous reſtauration of the two witneſſes <hi>Enoch and Elias</hi> from death to life after three dayes:
<note place="margin">Papiſts o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the vivification of the two witneſſes.</note> And <hi>Ribera</hi> diſputeth how the raiſing and glorification of the <hi>witneſſes</hi> agrees with that of <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. <hi>That with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us they might not be conſummated,</hi> or <hi>perfected.</hi> But their fabulous opinion touching <hi>Enoch</hi> &amp; <hi>Elias</hi> hath often been refuted, the which is here alſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtlie contradicted, in that the <hi>two witneſſes</hi> are ſaid to have <hi>tormented the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the earth.</hi> Now it is abſurd to imagine that two poore prophets ſhould torment all the tribes, peoples, nations and tongues of the whole earth in the ſpace of three yeeres.</p>
                     <p>So that this <hi>dualitie of the witneſses</hi> (ſo to ſpeak) cannot be reſtrained to two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, or unto two preciſely.</p>
                     <p>Now however the <hi>vivification of the witneſses</hi> ſhall literallie come to paſſe in the end of the world, yet unto that the ſpirit here hath no reſpect at all. But by this <hi>vivification</hi> is ſignified a perpetuall reſtoring of <hi>witneſses</hi> unto the Church militant, viz: that in ſtead of ſuch whom Antichriſt puts to death, the Lord will raiſe up others to hold forth the teſtimonie of Chriſt, and ſtrongly oppoſe the <hi>Beasts kingdome.</hi> For when Antichriſt ſhal thinke that all Chriſts witneſſes are ſuppreſſed, then others reſtored to life ſhall renew againe the battle againſt him. As therfore <hi>Elias</hi> is ſaid to have lived againe in <hi>John Baptist,</hi> not by a Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorean <gap reason="foreign">

And to this purpoſe that of <hi>Huſse</hi> being led to his martyrdom doth excellently ſerve: <hi>At the end,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>of an hundred yeeres</hi> (which before God are ſcarſly three dayes) <hi>yee ſhall anſwer to God and to mee.</hi> He ſaid alſo, <hi>now indeed ye burn a Gooſe</hi> (for <hi>Huſse</hi>

                     <p>This reſtoring of the <hi>witneſſes to life,</hi> ſerves for the conſolation of the Church militant: feeing there ſhall alwayes, (notwithſtanding all Antichriſtian perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) be ſome faithfull profeſſours of the truth, who ſhall ſtrongly fight for the glorie of Chriſt.

                     <p>That which is added touching the <hi>Glorification of the witneſſes</hi> ſerves alſo to comfort us. For to whom Antichriſt ſhall deny the fellowſhip of men, to them God will vouchſafe a heavenly fellowſhip: ſuch as he ſhal exclude out of the world, God wil receive them up into paradiſe: they whom here he will not admit to be honourablie buried, them God will crown with the glory of everlaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting life.

And therefore they ſhall ſtand in fear of their kingdome, treaſures, praebends, and kitchins. They ſhall dread the judgement of God, but not eſcape it. This is wonderfull in our eyes: The wicked when they moſt rage, do then tremble, &amp; are forced even to fear them whom they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute with all manner of hatred.

The <hi>ſecond</hi> is a triumphing ſong of the <hi>four and twenty elders,</hi> rendring thanks and praiſes to Chriſt for the deliverance of the Church, and intreating him to bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the wrath of the adverſaries by his judgement, and render rewards unto the godly, and due puniſhments unto the wicked, <hi>ver.</hi> 16.17, 18.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>third</hi> is the execution of judgement on both, <hi>ver.</hi> 19.</p>
                     <p>The ſcope is, to ſet forth the conſolation of the godly at laſt: for howſoever the Church on earth be in warr againſt Antichriſt, yet ſhe ſhall at length triumph with Chriſt in heaven.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And there were great voyces in heaven</hi>] Theſe are not the voyces of mourners,
<note place="margin">Great voyces of rejoycings.</note> but of them that rejoyce, tow it, of the bleſſed Angels and ſoules of the Saintes in heaven, as appeareth by the ſubject of the matter. But did not <hi>John</hi> threaten the third <hi>Woe?</hi> Yea he did ſo, but not to the heavenly inhabitants, nor unto the ſervants of God, but to the adverſaries, not in heaven, but upon the earth. Before
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:96676:149"/>the <hi>Woes</hi> therefore of the enemies (called in other places of ſcripture, <hi>gnaſhing of the teeth, the worme that dies not, unquencheable fire, tribulation and anguiſh,</hi> and here are named <hi>lightnings, voyces, thunders, earthquakes and haile,</hi> &amp;c.) Iohn heard the joy of them that were in heaven, celebrating with ſongs the equity and righteouſnes of the judgement to come. So then the third <hi>Woe</hi> ſhal fall, not upon the godlie, as the two former <hi>woes</hi> did on both Antichriſts, but upon the adverſaries, whom Chriſt will caſt <hi>into the lake of fire and brimſtone.</hi> And thus the firſt apparition or companie of the 24 <hi>Elders</hi> ſhall with ſongs of triumph put an end unto this <hi>third Viſion.</hi>

Now it is (as I ſaid) the triumph and joy of Angels and Saintes in heaven, becauſe the myſterie of God was finiſhed, according to the praediction in <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.7. that is, becauſe at laſt Chriſts kingdome was delivered out of all danger, and the power of the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries troden under foot: The ſenſe is thus: The adverſaries had violently taken into their poſſeſſion the kingdomes of the world, thruſting out, as much as lay in them, Chriſt: But now the kingdomes are returned unto Chriſt, who hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward (all enemies beeing deſtroyed) ſhall reigne alone.</p>

The beſt interpreter of this place is Paul, 1 Cor. 15. ver. 24. <hi>Then commeth the end when</hi> CHRIST <hi>ſhall have delivered up the kingdome to God &amp; the Father, &amp; ſhall have put downe all rule &amp; all authoritie &amp; power.

I anſwer, he ſhal deliver the kingdom to God, not by reſigning up the kingdome, but by ceaſing to reigne after that manner as hitherto he had done. Now he reignes by the meanes of his word, ſacraments and miniſters, gathering to himſelf and ſanctifying the Church here on earth: Then he ſhall reigne by immediate illumination and glorification of the Saintes in heaven. Now he ruleth in the midſt of his enemies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.25. Then he ſhall reigne alone without enemies. Now Antichriſt Chriſts corrival with all deceiveablenes of unrighteouſneſſe and by the power of Satan, doth ſubject the kingdoms of the world unto himſelf,</p>
                     <p>Then he ſhal be thrown down and aboliſhed by the brightnes of Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. Now God and Chriſt have a divided empire (ſo to ſpeake) with Satan, the Pope, and other tyrants, who chalenge much unto themſelves. But then all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies ſhall be aboliſhed, God and Chriſt ſhall have a full and entire kingdome over all: becauſe they ſhalbe all in all things. Chriſt the Son therfore ſhal reigne with the Father and holy Ghoſt for ever and ever, and not for a thouſand yeeres onely, (as the <hi>Chiliaſts</hi> dreame) of which afterward.</p>

                        <hi>Becauſe thou haſt taken to thee thy great power and haſt reigned</hi>] But what good comes hereby unto the Elders? indeed they have great cauſe to rejoyce for theſe benefits, conſidering that they ſerve to the eternal felicity of the Church trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant. Hitherto the Lord in ſuffering the fury of the adverſaries did ſeem not to exerciſe <hi>his great power,</hi> that is, his omnipotencie: and Chriſt to be overcome by Antichriſt: but at length by <hi>taking,</hi> that is, by exerciſing and ſhewing forth his power in caſting down the adverſaries, he delivered the afflicted Church out of all her trouble: and by <hi>reigning</hi> bleſſeth her with eternal happineſſe.

                     <p>
                        <hi>That thou ſhouldest give reward</hi>] They make two ſorts of people of ſuch as ſhal be judged, ſome to be rewarded, the other to be deſtroyed: as Chriſt in <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. &amp; <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. The reward of their faith ſhalbe given them, and of their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, conſtancie, patience, labours and miſeries. What reward? eternal life &amp; glorie. Vnto whom? They make three ſorts of ſuch as ſhalbe rewarded.
<note place="margin">Three rankes of ſuch as are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First</hi> they place, <hi>Gods ſervants the prophets:</hi> thereby comprehending the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of more ſpecial note whither under the Law or Goſpel, as <hi>Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, Evangelists,</hi> &amp;c. who were Gods ſervants by a more then orninary vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                     <p>Secondly <hi>the Saintes,</hi> to wit confeſſours and martyrs, who eyther by ſincere preaching, or conſtant martyrdome have held forth the glory of Chriſt againſt Antichriſt. Vnder whom are comprehended all faithfull teachers and preachers of the word, called <hi>Saints</hi> by an <hi>Hebraiſme,</hi> as ſeparated to ſome ſpecial work.</p>

                        <hi>In the third place,</hi> they add the <hi>fearers of Gods name,</hi> that is, all other faithful ones (beſides the two former companies) who from the beginning of the world unto the end therof have worſhipped the Lord in ſinceritie.
<note place="margin">What it is to feare the name of God.</note> For to <hi>fear the name of God,</hi> is to worſhip him ſincerely, to call upon him, and love him above all: becauſe <hi>the feare of the Lord is the beginning of wiſdome,</hi> &amp; godlineſſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Great and ſmall</hi>] They ſhew that the reward is common unto all, without any difference of merit either of greater or leſſer condition and ſtate: to the end, that neyther the great ones ſhould promiſe unto themſelves a greater reward, or the others deſpaire of the ſame recompence. <hi>Popiſh Sophiſters</hi> diſpute much touching the degrees of glorie, which rather proceedeth out of their own braine, &amp; from a falſe ſuppoſed foundation of humane merits, then from the Scriptures of God. But whither the Lord wil crown his ſervants with equal or unequal glorie, it ſhal not be according to their merit, but merely of his own grace. And this is all <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinian</hi> (againſt whom <hi>Jerom</hi> wrote) pleaded for, except I be deceived, viz. that unto all who kept their baptiſme, there ſhould be one recompence in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God. For he ſeems not to diſapprove of a degree of reward, but of merit.
<note place="margin">The crown of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded unto all the faithfull.</note> Paul the Apoſtle who was taken up into the third heaven, and inferiour to none of the Saintes, ſhewes us, that <hi>for him was laid up a crown of righteouſneſſe, which the Lord the righteous judge would give him at that day, and not unto him onely, but unto all that love his appearing.</hi> This ſame crown of righteouſneſſe the Elders doe promiſe unto the <hi>Prophets, and Saintes, and all the fearers of the name of God.</hi> This ſufficeth for our faith and conſolation. Let us leave diſputing in this life touching the differences of the <hi>crowne,</hi> and rather indeavour, ſo to walke, as that we may be made partakers therof in the life to come.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That thou ſhouldest give reward</hi>] Here fals in a queſtion. For a reward is given of merit and debt. Therfore ſay ſome, the reward of eternall life is given unto the Saintes, as a due debt: otherwiſe it would not be called a reward. Now it is not onely here ſo called,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20.8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4.</note> but in many other places: <hi>Great is your reward in heaven. Give unto them their reward or hire. Every one ſhall receive his own reward according to his own labour. But to him that worketh the reward is not given of grace, but of debt.</hi> Thus the mercenarie adverſaries of grace diſpute. But how eternal life is ſaid to be a reward, appeares by the words of the Apoſtle: <hi>The wages of ſin is death: but the gift of God is life eternal.
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23 <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.9.</note> It is the gift of God: not of workes least any man ſhould glorie.</hi> Now all gifts are gratis, (and not due debts.) Foraſmuch therfore as eternal life is a gift,
<note place="margin">Eternal life is mercy not merit.</note> it is of mercy, and not of merit. And it is called <hi>a reward</hi> not due, but freely given, ſuch a reward as a father gives to his ſon: not as a maſter unto his hired ſervant.</p>
                     <p>Neither is it contradictorie that the Apoſtle denies, that <hi>a reward is given of grace.</hi> For he denies it of a reward of workes: <hi>To him that worketh,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the reward is not imputed of grace but of workes.</hi> Now we denie that life eternal is ſaid to bee ſuch a reward. For not to workers but to beleevers is this reward given.</p>

For no debt can be ſaid to be a merit.</p>
                     <p>But thou wilt ſay,
<note place="margin">Howfar a promiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a debt.</note> every promiſe becomes a debt. This is true amongſt men, with whom there is a natural and legal obligation.

                        <hi>Great</hi>] In ſignification, that is, ſhadowing out great and wonderfull things. For what can be more wonderful, then that <hi>a cruel dragon</hi> ſhould ſtand ready to devoure the child of a weak woman in travaile, and yet not prevaile.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In heaven</hi>] Here I ſeek no myſterie, becauſe theſe mental apparitions were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to Iohn in heaven.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A woman clothed with the ſun] Ribera</hi> here moves two great and difficult que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions,
<note place="margin">Riberas two queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> as he cals them: One: what woman this was: <hi>whither the Church? or the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes bleſſed virgin Marie?</hi> becauſe ſome things agree to <hi>Marie:</hi> as that it is a <hi>woman clothed with the ſun: that ſhe brought forth a man child ruling the nations with a rod of iron,</hi> &amp;c. Some things agree not, that ſhe <hi>cryed for pain in travaile: that ſhe fled into the deſert,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Again,</hi> it ſeems not to agree to the Church: to bring forth <hi>a man child ruling the nations with a rod of iron:</hi> becauſe the Church did not beget Chriſt, but is begotten of him through his word: that alſo the <hi>dragon</hi> is ſaid, leaving the woman, to fight with her ſeed, &amp;c. At length he concludes out of <hi>Methodius</hi> with <hi>Ceſarienſis,</hi> that not the virgin Marie, but the Church is the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man here ſpoken of.</p>
                     <p>The other queſtion, as he ſaith, is more difficult: <hi>Whither this be ſpoken concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church in her first ſtate, that is, before Christ comming, or at his first comming, or of that ſtate which ſhe ſhalbe in, in the last age of the world.</hi> Now rejecting the former opinion, he ſuppoſeth that all is to be referred unto the laſt time of the Church, and the four yeeres reigne of his Antichriſt: and his reaſon is, becauſe the womans flight, and her abode in the wildernes 1260 <hi>dayes,</hi> as alſo the fight of <hi>Michael</hi> with the <hi>Dragon,</hi> doe altogether belong to Antichriſts time.</p>
                     <p>But I thinke I can move here a far more difficult queſtion,
<note place="margin">A more difficult queſtion about the woman.</note> that is, <hi>whither this woman flying into the wildernes,</hi> be not the ſame, whom Iohn ſaw in the wildernes ſitting on the ſcarlet coloured Beaſt, or another: of all which queſtions I wil ſpeak a few things.</p>
                     <p>As for the firſt;
<note place="margin">The Monk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish fable touching Maries aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is not hence proved.</note> This Viſion makes nothing for the eſtabliſhing of the <hi>Monkiſh dreames</hi> and pictures of the virgine Maries corporall aſſumption into heaven, and placing her on the Throne of the Trinitie, her beeing queen of heaven, and ſo clothed as the woman here appeared to Iohn. Theſe are mere <hi>apocriphal fictions,</hi> and contradictorie to Chriſtian relegion: Yea them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alſo confeſſe that this type doth not in many things agree with their fables.</p>
                     <p>This woman is a type of the Churches birth under the New Teſtament, allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the hiſtory of Chriſt beeing borne of the virgin Mary: for the hiſtorie of Chriſts comming in the fleſh, doth partly literally, &amp; partly allegorically very wel repreſent the future condition of the Church.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This</hi> woman brought forth a man childe:
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>A hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of this type with Marie and Chriſt. Mat.</hi> 2.13</note> ſo in the fulnes of time God ſent <hi>his ſon made of a woman</hi> Gal. 4.4.</p>
                     <p>The Dragon layes wait for the womans child: ſo <hi>Herod the tyrant ſought to kill Christ as ſoon as he was born.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Woman</hi> with Eagles wings flyes into the wildernes: ſo Mary being admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed of God, fled with the child into the deſerts of Aegypt.</p>
                     <p>The Woman was there ſuſtained, and kept 1260 dayes: ſo Mary remained in Aegypt neer four yeeres untill the death of Herod.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Dragon</hi> caſt forth a flood of waters after the Woman to devour her: So <hi>Herod</hi> after Maries flight, murdered all the infants of Bethlehem of two yeeres old and upward, that among them he might ſlay the womans child.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To be ſhortt,</hi> the childe of the woman was caught up into heaven, unto the throne of God, and made the feeder &amp; ruler of all nations: ſo Chriſt having finiſhed the worke of our redemption, aſcended into heaven, &amp; is ſet down on the throne of the Father, having all power in heaven and in earth.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things are now repreſented unto <hi>John,</hi> not as hiſtorical, ſeeing he was no way ignorant of them: neither as things to come to paſſe afterward, ſeeing they
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:96676:153"/>were already don: but as types of future things, myſtically ſetting forth the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture condition of the Church in this life.</p>
                     <p>For as the virgine Marie once brought forth Chriſt corporally: ſo the Church continually (as it were) in travaile, brings him forth in his members ſpiritually. Se Gal. 4.19.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Herod</hi> perſecuted Mary with her child: ſo that old Dragon by tyrants &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enemies ſhal perſecute the Church with her members.
<note place="margin">The allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Church &amp; Chriſts birth of the virgine.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mary</hi> flying from the tyrant, withdrew herſelf out of the ſight of the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, yet ſhe ſtill had a beeing, and was preſerved and nouriſhed in the deſerts of Aegypt untill her return: ſo the Church ſhunning Antichriſt, withdrew herſelf out of the eyes of the world, yet had ſhe a continuance ſtill, and was nouriſhed and preſerved in the wildernes of the world, untill the meaſuring of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Christ</hi> the ſon of the woman being taken up into heaven, was ſet on the throne of God: ſo the faithfull at length ſhalbe taken up into heaven, and reign with Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>So that this type doth excellently repreſent the hiſtorie both of the birth of Chriſt, and of the Church: <hi>The woman,</hi> repreſents Mary: <hi>The child</hi> taken up into heaven, Chriſt: <hi>The Dragon</hi> perſecuting the woman, <hi>Herod</hi> the tyrant: <hi>the taking up of the child unto Throne of God,</hi> Chriſts aſcention into heaven, &amp; his ſitting at the right hand of his Father. Notwithſtanding in a myſtical ſenſe, which onely is intended in this prophetical Viſion, the <hi>woman,</hi> is the Church: <hi>the child of the woman,</hi> &amp; <hi>her ſeed,</hi> are the faithfull of all ages: <hi>the Dragon</hi> is the Devill and all other perſecuting tyrants of the Church.
<note place="margin">Why the Church is repreſented under the type of a woman.</note> Furthermore it is not unuſuall in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to compare both the true and falſe Church unto a woman: as in <hi>Iſai:</hi> 54.1. it is ſaid unto the true Church: <hi>rejoyce O barren, thou which didst not bear, for more are the children of the deſolate then of the married wife:</hi> and Mica 7.8. the true Church ſaith to the falſe: <hi>rejoyce not againſt me O mine enemie becauſe I fall, for I ſhall ariſe,</hi> &amp;c. Hence generally the Church is called the <hi>ſpouſe of Christ, a chast and undefiled virgin:</hi> ſo Chap. 19.7. ſhe is called <hi>the wife and ſpouſe of the Lambe.</hi> The reaſon ſhe is ſo called, is both her ſpiritual marriage with Chriſt her bridegrome, as alſo the weaknes of that ſex: for the Church being like unto a weak woman, hath no humane ſtrength to ſubſiſt of herſelf. On the contrarie the Church of malignant men is compared to an <hi>adulterous woman,</hi> Ierem. 3.1. to a <hi>whore</hi> and moſt <hi>impure harlot</hi> Ezech. 16. &amp; Reve. 17.18. Thus we ſe what this woman is, &amp; I hope by this time <hi>Riberas</hi> firſt queſtion is fully anſwered.</p>
                     <p>Now I come to his <hi>ſecond queſtion:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">In what ſtate the Church is here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented.</note> he rightly denies that the Church is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the firſt ſtate, or as it was before the comming of Chriſt: although ſome doe thinke that there is an alluſion unto <hi>Eve</hi> our firſt mother, betwixt whoſe ſeed, and the ſerpents, God put enmity in the beginning: but this is without al ground. Neither was Iohn to be informed of the ſtate of the ancient ſynagogue: but of the condition of the new Church.</p>
                     <p>Now the other two things which he affirmeth are not true. <hi>One:</hi> that the ſtate of the Church at Chriſts comming is not here ſpoken of: for we have ſhewed the contrarie, becauſe the woman in travaile of Chriſt corporally, was a type of the Church beeing in travaile with Chriſt ſpiritually. <hi>The other:</hi> that he refers the event of this type unto the laſt times of his feined Antichriſt, who ſhal never come. As if the woman were not already long agoe fled into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp; perſecuted by the <hi>Dragon</hi> in her flight, as ſhall appeare more evidently by that which followes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Laſtly</hi> unto the <hi>third queſtion:</hi> viz. <hi>whither this woman flying into the wilderneſſe, be the ſame that ſate on the Beast</hi> Chap. 17. <hi>I ſay,</hi> that ſhe is, and is not: the which I thus manifeſt: It is plaine that the woman repreſents the Church. Now the Church by a diverſe ſignification is taken eyther for the Church of the <hi>firſt begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi> Heb. 12.22. which univerſally comprehends all the elect before, and under
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:96676:154"/>the law,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 38.</note> as alſo under the Goſpel, as <hi>Gregory</hi> affirmeth, and this is the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Creed:</hi> or, for <hi>the Church of the called,</hi> which in the New Teſtament is the multitude of them that profeſſe the faith of Chriſt in every place. In the former ſenſe the <hi>Woman,</hi> or Church is, and alwayes ſhalbe the onely ſpouſe of Chriſt: and never ſo degenerate as to become <hi>Antichriſts ſtrumpet:</hi> neither did this Church appeare unto <hi>John,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19.</note> for <hi>God knowes who are his:</hi> But ſhe appeared in the latter ſenſe, here indeed in this place, like unto a chaſt matrone, but in Chapter 17, as a great whore. But how then is ſhe the ſame? I anſwer, ſhe is the ſame in name but not in deed, in profeſſion, but not in faith: in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but not in truth: In the ſame ſenſe that Ieruſalem is called a <hi>holie city,</hi> as in Pſal. 122.3. and a <hi>harlot</hi> as Iſai: 1.21. At the firſt in the Apoſtles time, &amp; a while after, the whole Chriſtianity of the Eaſt and Weſt was as a chaſt matrone clothed with faith &amp; holineſſe as with the ſtarres: juſt ſo as ſhe here appeared. But after the deceaſe of the Apoſtles and Apoſtolical men, ſhe keept not long the chaſtitie of an undefiled matron,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>hiſt. cap.</hi> 32.</note> as in <hi>Euſebius</hi> is teſtifyed by <hi>Egeſippus</hi> a moſt ancient writer: untill at length poſſeſſing the mountaines of Rome, &amp; changing her <hi>ſtarlike habit</hi> into <hi>ſcarlet,</hi> ſhe ſate on the <hi>Beast,</hi> and degenerated into a common ſtrumpet as ſhe appeared Chap. 17.</p>
                     <p>Indeed the Romiſh paraſites ſtronglie cry out to the contrary, that the true Church of Chriſt, ſuch as was <hi>Rome</hi> (according to the Apoſtles teſtimonie) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fall away: that the ſpouſe of Chriſt cannot degenerate: The which is true of the Church of the firſt borne, the onely and true ſpouſe of Chriſt: but of every Church of the called (or of every particular Church) it is falſe, as, beſides very manie teſtimonies, the particular Churches of <hi>Corinth, Galatia, Epheſus, Philippi,</hi> &amp;c. confirme: for howſoever every one of them of old was a true Apoſtolicall Church and ſpouſe of Chriſt: Yet at this day where are they, or what manner of Churches are they become? Now what wonder is it though the ſame hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pined to Rome, although in a different condition: but let us return to the text.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The woman</hi> therefore or Church appeares as a chaſt mother <hi>in heaven:</hi> although ſhe warreth here on earth,

                     </p>
                     <p>As therefore the moon appeares in diverſe formes in the firmament:
<note place="margin">The condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church is variable in this world.</note> ſo is the Churches condition diverſe in this life: ſometimes ſhining in ful light: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while ſhe is ſcarcely to be ſeen, and ſometimes not at all, untill again her light break forth as out of darknes. This ſerves for the confutation of that Popiſh fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which is that the Church ſhall alwayes be as viſible in the world, as is the kingdome of Naples, or the like.</p>
                     <p>Moreover in that the <hi>Woman</hi> hath the <hi>moon</hi> under her feet, what is it? but that

                     <p>
                        <hi>And a crown of twelve ſtars on her head</hi>] This denotes the faith of the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall Church, the profeſſion whereof was as a crown unto her head.

                        <hi>For paine</hi>] Our <hi>Wafer-worſhippers</hi> cannot tell how to applie this to the <hi>Virgine mother:</hi> for they hold, that <hi>Marie</hi> was delivered without paine, grounding this on another falſe opinion, viz. that ſhe was free from the ſtain of original ſin: but neither of theſe opinions can be of faith: becauſe neither of them are grounded on the word of God. The virgins conceiving indeed was miraculous. But her bringing forth was natural, for by the opening of the wombe ſhe brought forth her firſt born ſon, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.23. But whither a natural delivery can be without paine, I leave to naturaliſts: <hi>Neither is it needfull to define that with danger,

And indeed the ſorrow of child bearing at firſt was impoſed on the woman by God, as a puniſhment of her ſin:
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.16.</note> 
                        <hi>I will multiply thy ſorrowes,</hi> &amp;c. Hence the ſcripture compares vehement and inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble anguiſhes unto the paine of a woman in travel, which the Greekes call by a peculiar word <gap reason="foreign">

<note place="margin">How the Dragon &amp; Beaſt differ</note> differs from the following <hi>Beast,</hi> in that the <hi>Dragon</hi> hath crownes on his head; the <hi>Beast</hi> on his <hi>hornes:</hi> ſo that the <hi>heads</hi> and <hi>hornes</hi> in this place, doe not ſignifie the ſame thing there, as we ſhall ſee herafter. Thus there is ſome difference betwixt the <hi>Dragon</hi> and the <hi>Beast,</hi> yet their like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is great: for the <hi>Dragon</hi> begate the <hi>Beast,</hi> even as like begets its like. Who this <hi>Dragon</hi> ſhould be, is very plain by the epithites: for he is called that <hi>Old Serpent, the Devil &amp; Satan</hi> ver. 9. &amp; Chap. 20.2. who is known of all to be that enemy of mankind. He is repreſented in the form of <hi>a ſerpent,</hi> both becauſe in likeneſſe of a ſerpent he ſeduced our firſt parents, as alſo becauſe of his rage &amp; cruelty againſt the Church, and laſtly becauſe of his poyſon wherwith he infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the world.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The heads and hornes</hi> of the <hi>Dragon,</hi> are the devils inſtruments, &amp; miniſters of his furie againſt the <hi>Woman.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In that the <hi>crownes</hi> are ſaid to be on his <hi>heads,</hi> &amp; not on his <hi>hornes,</hi> it argues, that the <hi>heads</hi> denote the chiefe inſtruments of the <hi>Dragon</hi> armed with regal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: But the <hi>hornes</hi> inferiour and vulgar, yet armed. The <hi>crowned heads</hi> therfore
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:96676:155"/>of the <hi>Dragon,</hi> are kings and tyrants perſecuting the woman: <hi>The hornes,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Who are the heads and hornes of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon.</note> are officers under them: as, governours, captaines, ſoldiours, hang-men and the like, by whom they exerciſe their crueltie, like as the head of a beaſt doth puſh with his hornes.</p>

                        <hi>Seven heads</hi>] indefinitely for many, as before: <hi>the ſeven ſpirits, ſeven lampes</hi> &amp;c. For a ſevenfold number is allwayes indefinite, except it bee reſtrained, as afterward it is, where it is ſaid, that the <hi>ſeven heads of the beast, are the ſeven mountaines of the woman or Rome.</hi> SO THE TEN HORNES indefinitelie are verie many, becauſe there are more inferiour executioners and murtherers, then kings.</p>
                     <p>Among the <hi>heads</hi> of the Dragon <hi>Herod</hi> the <hi>Aſcalonite</hi> is worthelie reckoned in the firſt place, as firſt labouring to deſtroy the womans ſeed,
<note place="margin">Who are the heads of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon.</note> for whoſe cauſe (almoſt as ſoon as he was borne) hee wickedlie cauſed all the infants of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> to be murthered.

                     </p>
                     <p>After theſe, the Romane tyrants perſecuting Chriſtians are to be numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>ſeven heads,</hi> as <hi>Nero, Domitian, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Verus, Commodus, Severus, Decius, Diocletian</hi> and other moſt cruell Serpents who wholy imbrued themſelves in the blood of the ſaintes, &amp; moſt miſerable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted the Church until <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time.</p>
                     <p>Of the <hi>Dragons hornes</hi> Pilate the Romane Governour was chiefe,
<note place="margin">Who are the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons hornes</note> who with the Scribes and Phariſees crucified the Lord of life: alſo his ſucceſſours, as <hi>Felix, Lyſias, Feſtus,</hi> with all ſuch as afterwards were aſſiſtants unto the <hi>Romane heads</hi> in perſecuting the ſaintes. Thus of neceſſitie theſe things muſt bee interpreted, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we would grope in darkeneſſe, for they altogether belong to demonſtrate the calamities of the primitive Church.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>And his taile drew the third part of the ſtars</hi>] Hitherto we have ſpoken of the Dragons form: now followes what he did <hi>viz.</hi> his twofould crueltie is here noted: the firſt againſt the <hi>Stars:</hi> the ſecond againſt the woman. <hi>He drew the third part of the ſtars</hi> &amp;c. This <hi>Andreas</hi> (but little to the purpoſe) interprets of <hi>Lucifer</hi> drawing with him verie many Angels into deſtruction: It is a Metaphoricall alluſion unto that in <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.10. touching <hi>Epiphanes,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The ſtars caſt down to the earth.</note> who (in the type of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt) <hi>cast down the ſtars to the ground, and ſtamped upon them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Stars</hi> in Chap. 1.10. ſignifie the teachers of Churches. Their <hi>caſting down from heaven to the earth,</hi> ſignifies their falling away from the faith and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venlie function, unto humane traditions and the cares of this life: as before we heard on Chap. 6.13. &amp; 8.10. &amp; 9.1. This the <hi>Dragon</hi> did by his <hi>taile,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The fail of the Dragon.</note> ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as ſome thinke, his fraudulent ſubtiltie: for as dogs with their tailes faune up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their maſters: ſo Satan drew by flaterie and lying promiſes many teachers from ſeeking after heavenlie things, and daſht them againſt the rocks of wordly honour. Now this indeed he hath don and yet dayly doth to the deſtruction of many: not withſtanding this is not al, for the Dragon begane his battel by open violence.</p>
                     <p>I therefore rather interpret the <hi>Dragons taile,</hi> (in which his chiefeſt ſtrength conſiſts) of the crueltie and long continued perſecutions, by which many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours of the name of Chriſt, who ought like ſtars to ſhine before others, partlie through torments and partlie through feare, have fallen from the faith and worſhipped devils. This happened under the cruel ſtormes of former perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as hiſtories teſtifie, &amp; principally under <hi>Domitian, Diocletian,</hi> &amp; <hi>Decius.</hi> For <hi>Diocletian</hi> (to alledge the words of <hi>Euſebius</hi> concerning his time onely) <hi>by a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall edict commanded the meeting houſes of Chriſtians to be laid even with the ground: then to burne the holy Scriptures:
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Lib.</hi> 8. <hi>hiſt. c.</hi> 3.</note> that the leaders of Chriſtians ſhould be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, fettered, and by torments conſtrained to ſacrifice unto Idols. Then many indeed beeing conſtant, ſuffered Martyrdom, but an infinite number of others</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>beeing
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:96676:156"/>overcom by fear, ſoon after the firſt brunt gave over wholy the combat.</hi> But what way ſoever we take it, it is an anticipation, that is the thinges are before related, which the <hi>Dragon</hi> did afterward.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Primaſius</hi> ſaith, that the <hi>taile are the falſe prophets, through whom the enemie fulfils his wickednes.</hi> As in Iſay. 9.15. <hi>The prophet that teacheth lies, is the taile:</hi> namelie, becauſe of their ſmooth and flattering ſermons. Now the <hi>Dragon</hi> did both. And therefore we may take both the ſenſes, making the ſumme to be thus: The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil both by the lies of deceivers, as alſo by the cruelty of tyrants drew many away from the faith, &amp;c. Of which ſeducement mention is made in verſ. 9. So then he caſts from heaven to the earth, becauſe he ſeduceth from the faith unto perfidiouſnes by the love of the earth, ſome by lies, others by tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>Not withſtanding when I compare the <hi>Viſions,</hi> I ſee that here the ſpirit pointes at the <hi>third, fourth</hi> &amp; <hi>fift trumpet</hi> of the foregoing <hi>Viſion:</hi> to give us to underſtand that the <hi>great Star</hi> called <hi>wormwood</hi> Cha. 8.10. with the third part of the ſtars: Ibid. v. 12. and that <hi>great Star</hi> fallen from heaven Chap. 9.1. were drawen and caſt to the earth by the fall of this Dragon: that is, fell away from the ſinceritie of the faith and Chriſtian pietie, to worldlie mindednes and Antichriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And the Dragon ſtood</hi>] Another enterpriſe of the Dragon againſt the woman: he ſtands before her to devoure her child: like as an hungrie wolfe ſtands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fowld,
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8</note> to deſtroy the ſheep that come forth. Satans ravenous appetite is inſatiable, the which he deſires to fill with our blood: therfore <hi>Peter</hi> deſcribes him under the type of a hungrie and roaring Lyon. But this is generall. Let us therfore applie it more nerely to the purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt</hi> the <hi>dragon</hi> endeavoured what he could to devoure Chriſt in his owne perſon, that is, when <hi>Herod</hi> the firſt head of the <hi>Dragon,</hi> beeing troubled at the hearing of Chriſt birth, moſt wickedlie murthered all the children of two yeers, that ſo he might not miſſe to devour the womans child: Alſo when <hi>Pilate</hi> the firſt <hi>horn of the Dragon</hi> condemned and crucified the ſon of God.</p>
                     <p>Afterward he mightelie laboured to deſtroy him in his members: when <hi>Herod Antipas</hi> beheaded the <hi>Baptiſt: Herod Agrippa</hi> tooke away the life of <hi>James:</hi> Againe when the other heades, as <hi>Nero, Domitian</hi> and the following tyrants by cruel edicts, puniſhments, rackings and perſecutions throughout the whole empire indeavoured by all meanes, to ſwallow up what ever the Church brought forth, that ſo they might deſtroy all Chriſtians and utterly blot out the faith of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Neither is <hi>Brightmans</hi> note to be diſapproved, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Dragon</hi> by tyrants did diligentlie watch, that there might not be born any defender of the Chriſtian religion.

                        <hi>Hee ſhall feed</hi> (or rule) <hi>all nations with a rod of iron</hi>] out of Pſal. 2. for hee is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the father to be the feeder or ruler of all nations, ruling them with an <hi>iron rod,</hi> that is, a moſt powerfull ſcepter (for iron is not fraile) yet in a diverſe or different way: ſome he quickneth by the <hi>ſcepter</hi> of his word and ſpirit, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth them, as his ſheep, into his ſheep fowld of glorie: Others by the ſame <hi>ſcepter</hi> hee breakes in pieces as a potters veſſel, and caſts them, (as goates) into hel fire: Chriſt therfore doth nothing feare the Dragons open mouth, becauſe he is a manchild: he cares not for his diadems, nor feareth his hornes: becauſe he can beate down all things with <hi>his rod of iron.</hi>
                     </p>

And here it is cloſely anſwered to what might be objected,
<note place="margin">Why the Dragon did not devoure the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child.</note> viz: Why did the Dragon ceaſe? &amp; wherefore did he not devoure the child ſo ſoon as he was born? two, or three reaſons are ſhewed how his endeavours were fruſtrated. The magnanimity, that is, the divine power of the <hi>manchild</hi> did terrify him: his <hi>iron ſcepter</hi> made him afraid, wherewith he bruiſeth his <hi>heads</hi> and <hi>hornes.</hi> But did he not ſwallow him up beeing dead? not in the leaſt: for though he bruiſed his heele, yet he could not hurt him, becauſe, beeing delivered from the power of death &amp; ſatan, he was taken up into heaven, &amp; ſate down at the right of God. For this alſo which is added, <hi>and he was caught up,</hi> &amp;c. may bee literallie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to Chriſt. However the prophetical ſenſe of this type is here chieflie to be conſidered.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Woman,</hi> that is, the Church brought forth a Son <hi>collective,</hi> for, many children of God, by the ſeed of the word. For even in the beginning by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall preaching many thouſands of Chriſtians were begotten to Chriſt: and the elect of God diſperſed throughout the whole earth were gathered by little &amp; little.</p>
                     <p>This generation is ſayd to be <hi>male-children,</hi> becauſe the elect beeing ſtrong in faith doe manfully reſiſt Satan:
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Io.</hi> 11, 52. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39.</note> They alſo in Chriſt their head <hi>ſhall rule the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with a rod of iron.</hi> Revel. 2.17. ſeeing the <hi>head</hi> communicates what is his, unto his members: hence <hi>the Saintes ſhall judge the world and Angels,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.2. <hi>They ſhalbe caught up to God</hi> alſo <hi>on his throne:</hi> becauſe beeing ſupported by the power of God they ſhall not fall under their temptations, but finiſhing their warfare with courage, ſhall obtain, (as conquerours) a crown of glorie with Chriſt: <hi>For to him that overcommeth he will graunt to ſit with him in his throne, even as he alſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came, and was ſet with his Father on his throne,</hi> Chap. 3.21. This conſolation did chiefly belong to the times of the martyrs, while Chriſt rode on the <hi>red horſe,</hi> even from <hi>Neroes</hi> perſecution unto that of <hi>Diocletian,</hi> as may plainly be gathered from v. 11. Now this allegoricall ſenſe by me expounded would have been the more obſcure as touching the members, but that the hiſtoricall ſenſe before was very plaine and cleare in Chriſt the head: and therfore it was neceſſarilie to be ſet down in the firſt place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Brightman</hi> takes this <hi>man child</hi> to be <hi>Conſtantine the great,</hi> who at length was brought forth by the Church as a patron and defender of the faith againſt <hi>Maxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, Licinius,</hi> and other enemies: But I know not, whither with more ſhew of reaſon, then <hi>Lyra</hi> who underſtands it as meant of <hi>Heraclius,</hi> who reigned (<hi>Phocas</hi> beeing taken away) very unproſperouſly. For here the womans ſeed doth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly denote the ryſe, and firſt ſtate of the primitive Church.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>And the woman fled into the wilderneſſe</hi>] Vnleſſe here we take notice of the <hi>anticipation,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans flight &amp; reaſon thereof.</note> mentioned in the <hi>Analyſis,</hi> and which our <hi>Toſſanus</hi> hath rightly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, many intricate queſtions will ariſe: as, how in this verſe the woman is ſaid to flie into the wilderneſſe, and again in v. 14? whither ſhe once returned? fled twiſe? fled thither before the battel? how ſhe flue before ſhe received wings? &amp;c. Therfore her flight is put by an <hi>anticipation,</hi> but came to paſſe afterward when the Dragon was caſt into the earth: and after a new perſecution was raiſed againſt her v. 13. For ſhe fled not ſo ſoon as ſhe was delivered (&amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed bow could ſhe flie having newly brought forth) but ſome while after. Firſt <hi>Michael</hi> thruſt the Dragon out of heaven: Hereupon the heavenly inhabitants ſang their triumphant ſong: The Dragon then to revenge the loſſe of his prey, and his own ruin, began to follow after the woman. She then hath wings given her, &amp; ſo flies into the wilderneſſe. And this is the order of the Viſion. Thus her flight is here brought in by an <hi>anticipation:</hi> becauſe the ſpirit having ſhewed how the child was delivered from the Dragons fury, would alſo adde ſomething touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the womans preſervation from the ſame: Hee, by beeing caught into heaven; The woman by flight into the wilderneſſe: howbeit not together at one time: for betwixt theſe things there happened a cruel battel in heaven betwixt Michael
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:96676:157"/>and the Dragon: as alſo the Dragons new enterpriſe againſt the woman on earth: upon this <hi>John</hi> returns unto the flight and perſecution of the woman. Therfore we will reſerve the interpretation of this verſe, till we come to v. 14. Now onely let us take notice of the ſumme and drift.</p>
                     <p>FIRST, <hi>the flight of the woman into the wildernes,</hi> ſignifies the inviſibility of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Church, after ſhe had fought many battels with tyrants, hereticks and hypocrites. For as the Moon comming ſo low as the ſhadow of the earth, gives noe light, neither for the preſent is more ſeen, then if it were not in the ſkie: ſo the Church that chaſt mother, through the ſhadow of worldly ambition,
<note place="margin">The Church vanished as the moon.</note> covetouſnes luxurie &amp; power of prelates and carnal prieſts, loſt her light by little and little, and at length vaniſhed away, inſomuch as ſhe never appeared any where in the world in her primitive beauty. The Papiſts affirme that their Church never fled or vaniſhed away: &amp; contend that ſhe allwayes ſhined in her full light: by which they deny that their Church is this chaſt mother. Hiſtories indeed ſhew, that Rome of old was a chaſt mother, but ceaſed ſo to be by changing the government of Chriſt inſtituted by his Apoſtles, into the Eccleſiaſtical and ſecular kingdom of the Pope: the which when and how it came to paſſe hath already been ſhewed ſeveral times, &amp; ſhall further be ſpoken of afterward.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> in that there is <hi>a place prepared for her in the wilderneſſe where ſhe is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed,</hi> it ſignifies that however the puritie of the Church ſhall then fade away, and the outward face thereof appear wholy diſcrepant from the primitive ſtate: yet God will reſerve and feed ſome remnants. Of the reſt in verſe 14.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>And there was warre in heaven</hi>] Which happened not after the womans flight into the wilderneſſe, but after the manchild was caught up into heaven. For the <hi>Dragon</hi> beeing diſappointed of one prey, he thirſted after the other: that is, ſeeing he could not deſtroy the child, he attempts to devoure the mother. But <hi>Michael</hi> is preſent in her behalfe, provoking the Dragon to combat: and thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, beeing overcom, with his followers out of heaven: whence aroſe a ſhout among the heavenly ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>What is meant by this battel, and when it was, is not eaſie to be expounded.
<note place="margin">What the war was between Michael and the Dragon. Riberas fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are ſome who refer it to the firſt fall of the devill, when <hi>Lucifer</hi> with his Angels was caſt down out of heaven.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Ribera</hi> rightly rejects: yet puts in the place thereof a ſtrange fiction of his own: viz. of a battel that ſhalbe betwixt Antichriſt and the Saintes about the laſt four yeers before the end of the world. But without all doubt this battel is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready fought, and the <hi>Dragon caſt into the earth:</hi> becauſe the woman long agone is fled into the wilderneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Others take it as an alluſion to the battel of Michael with ſatan about the bodie of Moſes, mentioned in <hi>Jude</hi> verſ. 9. But the cauſe of the war there, is other then here.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Brightman</hi> thinkes that <hi>Conſtantines</hi> victory over <hi>Maxentius, Maximinus</hi> and <hi>Licinius</hi> heads of the Dragon, is here ſet forth. But the effects of the victorie (celebrated with ſongs by them in heaven, verſ. 10.11.) Seem to be more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, then can poſſiblie be reſtrained to <hi>Conſtantines</hi> temporall victorie.</p>
                     <p>As therefore in the ſigne of the woman, her deliverie, and the child, there was a double ſenſe: One <hi>Hiſtoricall</hi> fulfilled in the perſon of Marie, and Chriſt. The other <hi>Allegoricall</hi> in the Church and members of Chriſt: ſo we may rightlie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret this combat in a twofold ſenſe: firſt ſpiritually of the conflict of Chriſt and Satan, the which went before in order of time. Secondly <hi>Hiſtoricallie of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantines</hi> and the enemies battles, which happened afterward. For as Chriſt caught up into the throne of God: thruſt Satan out of his kingdome, and brought e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal peace and ſaftie unto the Saintes by his interceſſion. So <hi>Conſtantine</hi> bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advanced on the throne of the empire, did manfullie ſuppreſſe all enemies of Chriſtianitie, and brought in a breathing time unto the Church, after her former &amp; long continued afflictions. This is the ſumme. Now let us conſider the battell:
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:96676:158"/>of which: 1. the place: 2. the Captaines and armies: 3. the event: laſtly the effect and benefit therof is explained.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The place</hi> of the war was heaven. But heaven is a place of peace, not of war: of quietneſſe not of diſſention.
<note place="margin">The war in heaven is viſional not reall.</note> It is ſo indeed. This is therefore to bee attributed onelie unto the Viſion, the which Iohn ſaw in the heaven above. The <hi>Captaine,</hi> and <hi>armie</hi> fighting on the one ſide were <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels. On the other ſide the <hi>Dragon</hi> with his Angels. As the <hi>Dragon</hi> is Satan: So <hi>Michael</hi> is Chriſt the <hi>Manchild caught up into heaven.</hi> MICHAEI beeing interpreted is, <hi>Who is like God?</hi> Now who is like God ſave Chriſt his onely begotten ſon? So <hi>Daniel</hi> alſo brings in Chriſt under the name of Michael, Chap. 11. and 12. Propheticallie pointing at this battel. <hi>At that time Michael the great prince ſhal ſtand up for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of his people, viz.</hi> having finiſhed the worke of our redemption in the fleſh. But what manner of battel is it?</p>
                     <p>The firſt conflict conſiſted in Satans temptations,
<note place="margin">The firſt conflict of this war.</note> the which Chriſt did offten moſt ſtronglie ſuſtaine and ſuppreſſe.</p>
                     <p>The ſooreſt conflict, was his bloodie ſweating in the garden, that which hee ſuffered in the high prieſts hall, and on the croſſe at his death.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Michael</hi> indeed ſeemed to have bin overthrown: but a while after the adverſaries power was broken: for by death <hi>Michael</hi> overcame: and riſing again he bruiſed the Dragons heades: and beeing lift up unto the throne of his father he triumphed over all principallities and powers.
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Col.</hi> 2 15</note> Then as a conquerour hee aſcended with his bodie, (on which he had born and by his blood purged the ſins of men) into heaven, and by the efficacie of his eternall interceſſion repreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the accuſations of the adverſarie, hath made up our everlaſting peace with God. This myſterie of our ſalvation is ſhadowed out under the type of this bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, as plainlie appeares from verſ. 10.11. The which typicall repreſentation did verie much ſerve for the conſolation of the Church, ſeeing ſhe ſhould be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with moſt cruell ſtormes of perſecutions for the ſpace of three hundred yeers: leaſt the faithfull beeing unmindful both of this fight &amp; victorie, might faint un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the long continuance of the croſſe.</p>
                     <p>But how are the Angels joyned with <hi>Michael</hi> in the fight,
<note place="margin">Why the Angels are joyned with Chriſt and who they are.</note> ſeeing <hi>Christ alone hath troaden the Wine-preſſe of Gods wrath,</hi> and overcom the Dragon? This is to be referred to the decencie of the Viſion. For a captain doth not uſe to fight without an armie: And all though Chriſt alone hath fought the battell hand to hand (as it were) with Satan, yet hath he alſo left occaſion of combatting unto his Angels: that ſo they might not ſtand ſtill, and onely behold their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine fighting, but couragiouſlie imitate him in the ſame. The Angels of <hi>Michael</hi> were the Apoſtles, who next unto the captaine, ſuffered the adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries rage: Togither with all other faithfull and elect ones, ſtanding conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuallie in battel aray under Chriſt their leader. So alſo the <hi>Dragon</hi> hath his <hi>Angels</hi> joyned with him, the which are his <hi>heades</hi> and <hi>hornes, viz.</hi> all inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the devill whither high or low, by whom he exerciſeth his violence againſt Chriſt and the Church. This is the ſpirituall combat betwixt Chriſt and Satan.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>And prevailed not</hi>] The event of the war is, that the <hi>Dragon</hi> with his follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers ſtood not in battell, but fleeing were caſt downe to the earth. <hi>Great</hi> indeed and cruel is the <hi>Dragon:</hi> but <hi>Michael</hi> is greater and more powerfull. Satan is that <hi>ſtrong armed man,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Math.</hi> 12.29. <hi>Luk.</hi> XI. 21. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14.</note> poſſeſſing his houſe in peace, and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church: but Chriſt ſtronger then hee, beeing come, takes away his palace, overcomes him and divides his ſpoiles. <hi>For by death he deſtroyed him that had the power of death, that is, the devill, and delivered them who through the feare of death, were all their life time ſubject to bondage.</hi> Now as Chriſt ſits triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the right hand of God: ſo there was no place found for Satan in heaven: but hee was caſt to the earth like a champion broken and overcome: whom then
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:96676:158"/>we clearely judge to be conquered when we ſee him lie groveling on the ground. This thruſting down of Satan out of heaven was myſticall, not hiſtorical, of which alſo Chriſt ſpeakes in the Goſpel: <hi>I beheld ſatan as lightning fall from heaven:</hi> And again: <hi>Now is the judgement of this world: now ſhall the prince of this world be cast out:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.31.</note> For the ſpreading of the Goſpell through the world was Satans overthrow &amp; the deſtruction of his kingdom. So Chriſt beeing neere his death, ſaith, <hi>The Prince of this world is Judged.</hi> That is beeing ſhortlie to be <hi>Judged,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>he is Iudged:</hi> like as a dying man, is ſaid to be dead, or the like. For in his death he threw down Satan by merit: In his reſurrection and aſcention by efficacie: viz ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the holy Ghoſt from heaven, throw whoſe grace Satan is thruſt forth out of the harts of the faithfull.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Andreas</hi> alſo gives a touch of the myſticall ſenſe of this war and victorie of <hi>Michael:</hi> applying the caſting down of the <hi>Dragon</hi> here,
<note place="margin">Andreas opinion.</note> Vnto the ſecond fall of Satan, by which he was overcome and thrown down through the croſſe of Chriſt: Namelie, when the Prince of this world was judged, and thruſt from that tyrannie which he before exerciſed.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>That old Serpent</hi>] Now, that we might not imagine this to be a naturall <hi>Dragon,</hi> he ſets him forth by his proper names or ſurnames, whence we may know both his naturall diſpoſition, and who he is.</p>
                     <p>He calls him, <hi>that old Serpent</hi>] as afterward in Chap. 20: verſ. 2.10. To wit,

                     <p>
                        <hi>Brightman,</hi> as I ſaid, expounds it hiſtoricallie, making <hi>Michael</hi> with his Angels to be <hi>Conſtantine</hi> with his legions: The <hi>Dragon</hi> with his Angels <hi>Maxentius, Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus</hi> and <hi>Licinius,</hi> by whoſe tyrannie Satan did vomit out his laſt hatred againſt Chriſtians, againſt whom <hi>Conſtantine</hi> warred.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Maxentius</hi> flieing over a certaine bridge was drowned in tyber. <hi>Maximinus</hi>
                        <pb n="268" facs="tcp:96676:159"/>periſhed in miſerable exile. And <hi>Licinius</hi> at laſt was alſo put to death. So the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> was then caſt down from heaven to the earth, theſe tyrants beeing driven out of the borders of the Church. Now whither this be the meaning of the type, I dare not affirme, ſeeing the proper and expreſſe deſcription of the Dragon ſeems verie much to condradict the ſame as here, ſo alſo afterward Chap. 20.2. Where the ſame apprehending of Satan is figured out in another type and to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>And I heard a great voyce</hi>] The warre and victorie of <hi>Michael,</hi> and the overthrow of the <hi>Dragon</hi> have bin ſpoken of.

                        <hi>The great voyce</hi> that Iohn heard ſignifies the multitude of rejoycers, and the greatnes of their joy becauſe of the victorie. From verſ. 11. it may be gathered that they were the ſaintes in heaven, who acknowledge the Church militant for their brethren. Therfore all the heavenlie companies ſing togither, excepting the <hi>third</hi> companie of Angels, and the fourth of other creatures.</p>
                     <p>The propoſition of their ſong is in verſ. 12. <hi>rejoyce yee heavens, and yee that dwell in them.</hi> In calling upon the heavens themſelves to rejoyce, they amplifie the excellencie of the benefit: for great joy is cauſed by great mercies. This <hi>Proſopopoeja</hi> is often uſed, as afterward in Chap. 19.20. ſo in Iſa. 1.2. <hi>heare ye heavens.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And yee that dwell in them</hi>] that is, the Angels of heaven, whom they invite to rejoyce with them. The arguments of their joy are the worthie benefits of the victorie, which are three in number, as we ſhewed in the analyſis. <hi>The firſt is,</hi> that by this victorie comes <hi>ſalvation, and ſtrength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Chriſt.</hi> The like benefits were ſet forth in the foregoing viſion, at the ſounding <hi>of the ſeventh Angel:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Cha.</hi> 11.15</note> but ariſing from a different cauſe. There the dwellers in heaven rejoyced for the finall judgement, and deſtruction of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt and other adverſaries: here they exult for the firſt victorie of <hi>Michael</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Dragon,</hi> by which is <hi>come ſalvation, and ſtrength</hi> &amp;c: Now howſoever God and Chriſt had this evermore before: yet the ſame appeared not ſo fullie, becauſe of the wickeds rage and tumult, the which they ſeemed to winke at: But then they openlie declared their power, &amp;c. When <hi>Michael,</hi> that is, Chriſt by his death, reſurrection and exaltation brake the power of the Dragon, and caſt him to the earth. Beſides they had it not alwayes for us, that is, for our help and conſolation. But at laſt it came to bee <hi>ours</hi> and for us through the victorie of <hi>Michael.</hi> For it is to be obſerved, that they ſay not, theſe things <hi>came to God and to Chriſt,</hi> but that <hi>now the ſalvation and power of God and of Chriſt was come,</hi> that is, was gotten, given and communicated to us. For through Chriſts victorie <hi>the ſalvation of our God is come,</hi> viz. unto us from our God. Then the power of our God did manifeſt it ſelf, when it drew us as a loſt prey out of the Dragons jawes. Then Gods kingdom became ours, when we beeing delivered out of the power of darkeneſſe,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.13 <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4.</note> were tranſlated into the kingdome of his beloved Son. Then Chriſts power became ours, when he, having over come death and Satan, was declared to be the ſon of God powerfullie according to the ſpirit of ſanctification by the reſurrection from the dead. This is the firſt argument of joy to the heavenlie ſpirits and to us: in regard that our ſalvation is founded in the victorie of <hi>Michael,</hi> and that the power and kingdome of our God is vindicated from the violence of the Dragon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Our God</hi>] ſo they call him, that we might confidentlie truſt, that by this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie God is reconciled unto us,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.33.</note> for ſo Chriſt bids us, ſaying, <hi>bee of good cheere I have overcome the world.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this ſpiritual joy may alſo be added that outward rejoycing of Chriſtians,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:96676:159"/>when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Emperour had driven the foreſaid <hi>Dragons</hi> out of heaven to the earth. Thus (I ſay) <hi>ſalvation, ſtrength, kingdome and power of God and Christ</hi> did ſeeme to <hi>come,</hi> when a Chriſtian Emperour was ſet on the throne, glorifyed God, publickly maintained Chriſts power, and freed the Church from tyrannie: <hi>For the kingdome of God is viſiblie ſeen, as it were</hi> (ſaith Brightman) <hi>when godlie princes are placed at the ſtern.</hi> The which indeed is true: But here it is a ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darie ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For the accuſer of our bretheren is cast down</hi>] The ſecond benefit of the victorie, and argument of joy, is the immunitie of the Godly from ſatans accuſations. Whom before he called a <hi>ſlaunderer, adverſarie, and deceiver:</hi> he now cals him <hi>our accuſer.</hi> It is an alluſion to the court, where the judge ſitteth on the tribunal:
<note place="margin">Satans Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt ſinners.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom is brought a guilty perſon, with his accuſer demanding his life. This judge is God: <hi>For he will judge the world in righteouſnes: and ſhall miniſter judgment to the people in uprightnes.</hi> Before his tribunal we all ſtood guiltie of eternal death through ſin: Gods revenging juſtice ſtood againſt us, requiring, that we ſhould ſuffer temporal and eternal puniſhments, For what was committed by us againſt his infinite majeſty:
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.32.</note> 
                        <hi>For it is the judgement of God that they who commit ſuch things are worthie of death.</hi> Againſt us ſtood the law of God pronouncing curſings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the tranſgreſſours thereof: Our own evill conſcience alſo, arguing and convincing us of eternall guiltineſſe. But Chriſt our Michael pleaded our cauſe before God, and by ſuffering death for our ſakes, moſt fullie ſatisfyed his juſtice, and healed our wounded conſciences from the ſting of ſin, purging and ſanctifying our harts through faith by his ſpirit:
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Act.</hi> 15.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1.</note> and therefore <hi>there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to us who are in Chriſt.</hi> Notwithſtanding ſatan left not off to proſecute his action, to accuſe and blame us, to ſtirre up God againſt us, and to rage againſt the faithfull.</p>
                     <p>In that he is ſaid <hi>to accuſe us day and night before God,</hi> it doth emphaticallie ſet forth ſatans malice: he knowes <hi>God is ours,</hi> that is, reconciled unto us in Chriſt: yet he impudently blameth us, to make him, if he could, not to be ours. But thankes be to God: Michael hath caſt this impudent railer out of heaven, that hence forward he might no more moleſt the Lord with his lying accuſations.</p>
                     <p>If this great benefit gave occaſion of ſo great joy to the heavenly inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, then much more to us: For the Dragon was not an accuſer of them in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but of us, who as yet walk in the ſlipperie pathes of this world. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſay: <hi>The accuſer of our bretheren,</hi> to wit, they who as yet have their war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare here on earth.</p>
                     <p>This is a worthie thing, that the Church triumphant acknowledgeth us to be bretheren. And indeed the Catholick or univerſall Church is a communion of all the Saintes both in heaven and in earth. So Chap. 6.11.</p>
                     <p>Hence firſt the doctrine of the Goſpel touching free juſtification by faith is here confirmed. For if our <hi>accuſer</hi> bee caſt out, then certainlie,
<note place="margin">Free juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by faith here eſtablished.</note> no man accuſing us, God the judge will not condemn, but acquit and juſtifie them, who by faith are in Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
                     <p>It confirmes alſo the doctrine of the full aſſurance of our faith and ſalvation.
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>The full aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of faith touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Rom.</hi> 8.33.</note> For if Chriſt hath ſatisfyed Gods judgement for us, and ſilenced our accuſer: then verely henceforward we may fullie perſwade our ſelves of the clemencie <hi>&amp; Philantropie</hi> of God the judge, who wils not the death of a ſinner, but that he be couverted and live: for <hi>who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? it is God that juſtifieth: who is hee that condemneth? It is Chriſt that died, yea rather that is riſen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh interceſſion for us. Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt? ſhall tribulation, or diſtreſſe, or perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, nay in all theſe things wee are more then conquerours through him, who hath looved us in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="270" facs="tcp:96676:160"/>
Secondly, it ſerves to exhort us, conſidering the ſpirit ſaith that our <hi>accuſer</hi> is caſt out, not troden under foot. It is true he can doe nothing againſt us before Gods judgement ſeat: Nevertheleſſe he ceaſeth not to proſecute the ſuit againſt us amongſt worldly men, whome he ſtirrs up exceeding lie to wrath and rage therefore we muſt not give our ſelves to carnall ſecurity: but watch and pray hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alwayes our loines girt, that we enter not into temptation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Brightman</hi> alſo interprets theſe accuſations hiſtoricallie, applying them to the reproaches of pagans againſt Chriſtians, who objected to them that they had their ſuppers like that of <hi>Oedipus,</hi> that they were inceſtuous perſons, and adulterers, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying their luſt in common, that they were manſlayers and conſpiratours againſt princes, &amp; cauſe of all publick calamities, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his <hi>Apologie</hi> witneſſeth: the which calumnies of whom learnt they them, but of the devill that <hi>old ſerpent</hi> and father of lies. Now howſoever this be true, yet is it to be taken in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarie ſence.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. <hi>And they overcame him</hi>] <hi>They,</hi> to wit <hi>our bretheren.</hi> The third benefit of the victorie and argument of joy, is the victorie of the Church militant over the <hi>Dragon,</hi> as if they ſhould ſay: Chriſt hath overcome him: &amp; we the inhabiters of heaven rejoyce at the victorie: Beſides our brethren alſo have overcome: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let them likewiſe rejoyce: But how have they overcome?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>By the blood of the Lambe</hi>] Hence it is apparent in the firſt place,
<note place="margin">The Lamb &amp; Michael is Chriſt.</note> that <hi>the Lamb</hi> &amp; <hi>Michael</hi> is one and the ſame, viz. Chriſt Ieſus. Secondly that the war with the <hi>Dragon</hi> and the victorie over him was chiefly in the blood of Chriſt, his death, reſurrection and exaltation: in regard therefore the <hi>Lamb</hi> hath overcome the Dragon: the godly alſo have over come him, becauſe they have waſhed and made their garments white in the blood of the Lamb: that is, they are juſtified and ſanctified in the blood of Chriſt: ſo that the merit and victorie of the <hi>Lambs blood,</hi>

                        <hi>they neglected,</hi> or, <hi>contemned</hi> their life, as <hi>Brightman</hi> hath well obſerved. It is a paraphraſe of the conſtancie of their faith even unto martyrdom:
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:96676:160"/>for the name of Chriſt: without which conſtancy, the <hi>Dragon</hi> is not conquered in reſpect of us: not that all are to lay down their lives, but all, being called ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by Chriſt, are to be prepared for it. For he which looſeth his life for Chriſts cauſe, doth finde it: but he looſeth it, who layes it not down for Chriſt. Now it appeareth that this ſong of triumph is to bee extended unto the times of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs under <hi>the Romane tyrants</hi> before <hi>Constantine,</hi> who then indeed put an end to the martyrdoms of Chriſtians.

                     <p>They adde the cauſe of the danger: <hi>For the devil is come downe unto you</hi>] It is true, ſatan did never ceaſe from raging in the world, after he was once thruſt out of heaven. But this is a prophetical threatning of other plots at hand, by which, not long after this revelation, he ſhould bring to deſtruction all the inhabitants of the earth, and ſea through out the Chriſtian world, as wholy given to all manner of ſuperſtition by Antichriſts meanes. Seeing therefore, by what hath been ſpoken, and hereafter more ſhall be, it appeareth that the darkneſſe and calamities of Antichriſt came into the world about the yeere of our Lord 606. this <hi>Wo</hi> is altogether to be referred unto that time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Brightman</hi> conſents that <hi>the inhabitants of the earth,</hi> are all ſorts of wicked men hypocritically profeſſing Chriſtianitie, viz. all the inhabiters of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts kingdome.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Becauſe he knoweth</hi>] The cauſe of this his great furie, is the ſhortnes of time allotted him to rage in, or, immunitie from the eternall torments of hell, to which he knowes himſelf to be ordained. And therefore he will make up the the brevitie of the time with unwearied indeavour of doing miſchief, not let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting paſſe a moment without ſatisfying his poyſoned luſt on the miſerable inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the earth.

                     <p>We added ſome expoſitions of our own divines: and at length followed that which ſeemed the moſt ſafe: viz. that a definite time was put for an indefinite, of which alſo the moſt learned BIBLIANDER thus writes in his Chronologie: <hi>The time, times, and halfe a time doth not ſignifie three yeeres and an halfe: but according to the proprietie of the Hebrew language, a time not certaine and definite, whither long, or ſhort, or betwixt both, in which God will permit Antichrist, to rage according to his pleaſure against Chriſts ſervants, the holy law and true religion.</hi> This <hi>time</hi> (I ſay) touching the Churches baniſhment is defined in the eternal counſell of God, but ſo far as concernes the terme can not poſſiblie be found out by mans reckoning.</p>

Notwithſtanding if this ſhalbe underſtood of a definite time in reſpect of us, becauſe the number of the <hi>dayes</hi> and <hi>moneths</hi> is again &amp; again definitely repeated, for my part then I ſhould thinke that a prophetical number of dayes is put for the yeeres, in which Antichriſt ſhould reigne and rage in full vigor, viz. 1260 <hi>yeeres,</hi> which begane (as before I ſhewed) with his firſt riſing: for then <hi>this woman fled into the wilderneſſe:</hi> and the harlot ſucceeded in her roome.</p>
                     <p>If thou demaund, ſeing the Church begane ſoon to flee after <hi>Conſtantines time,</hi> wherfore then are not the 1260 <hi>yeeres</hi> reckoned from thence? I anſwer, her flight, &amp; the time of her exile is not altogether one thing. For her flight begane from <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and dured untill <hi>Phocas,</hi> almoſt 300 <hi>yeers,</hi> after which time the woman begane to bee in the wilderneſſe. For neither are we to imagine, that the Church was caried by flight in one day, moneth or yeer into the wilderneſſe: but by little &amp; little, as ſhe loſt her heavenly endowments, changed her clothing and corrupted her chaſtity: by degrees therfore (I ſay) the Apoſtolical ſinceritie of faith &amp; order did wear out: and the corruptions, ſuperſtitions and heatheniſh abominations &amp; idols were brought in: together with that <hi>Pagan-Jewiſh hierarchie,</hi> which to this day Rome with ſo great pompe &amp; luxuriouſnes boaſteth of: for Antichriſts apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy was not at the higheſt all of a ſudden, but encreaſed by ſlow paces: till the pride and tyrannie of the <hi>Romane Biſhops</hi> was lifted up and eſtabliſhed.

                     <p>Vntil <hi>Sylveſter</hi> I. all the Romane Biſhops were martyrs for the ſpace <hi>of</hi> 310 <hi>yeeres:</hi> from that time to <hi>John</hi> 1. they were all Archbiſhops, for the ſpace <hi>of</hi> 200 <hi>yeers,</hi> until the yeer 520. at which time the <hi>Romane Praelates</hi> were created Patriarchs by <hi>Juſtine Caeſar.</hi> Then the <hi>woman</hi> almoſt by flying was come to the <hi>wilderneſſe.</hi> Notwithſtanding the time of baniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t began 86 <hi>yeeres</hi> after, when from <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs</hi> they became to be open &amp; very <hi>Antichrists:</hi> when, I ſay, <hi>Phocas</hi> the parricide, contrarie to the mindes both of the <hi>Graecian</hi> &amp; <hi>Latine Biſhops,</hi> raiſed up <hi>Boniface the</hi> III. with a mighty tumult of men into the throne OF VNIVERSAL PESTILENCE, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him to be worſhipped, &amp; proclaimed <hi>prince &amp; Lord of all Biſhops.</hi> Hitherto the flight ſtill dured. <hi>After this</hi> was her exile in <hi>the wildernes.</hi> The long time of her <hi>flight</hi> is ſignified by <hi>the two wings,</hi> not of a dove, but <hi>a great Eagle,</hi> that is, able to cary her a long while, as I before noted. For the <hi>woman</hi> was not to fly a little time, but <hi>her flight into the wilderneſſe</hi> was to be through groues &amp; great woods, through fields &amp; ſeas, til ſhe came in a certain place of the wildernes prepared by God: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Eagles wings</hi> were required: becauſe the Eagle holds out longeſt in flying.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Who are the reſt of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſeed.</note> here are named <hi>the reſt of the ſeed of the woman.</hi> Now theſe are the faithfull, who ſeeing all the publick congregations in the Papacy corrupted, withdrew themſelves, and privately worſhipped the Lord according to his inſtitution in their owne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, of whom alſo ſome openly oppoſed the <hi>Beaſt</hi> even from the firſt riſing of the Papacy until this day: againſt theſe what manner of warr the Dragon hath made by <hi>the Romane Beaſt, the books of Martyrs</hi> plentifully declare, as alſo <hi>the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and Popiſh inquiſition,</hi> which hath drawen many thouſands of Saintes unto the gibbet, fire, and other exquiſite torments: beſides the warres of Popes againſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Emperours &amp; Kings, for the upholding of their tyranny, the which for the preſent I wil not ſpeak off. At that time indeed <hi>the Dragon</hi> could not warr againſt the woman, that is, againſt whole congregations of the Saintes, becauſe ſuch were not viſible: therfore he ſtrives by al mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s poſſible to extirpate the reſt of her ſeed, which was ſcattered here &amp; there. But more of this war in the following Chapter.</p>
                     <p>By two Epithites <hi>the womans ſeed</hi> is ſet forth: <hi>that they keep the commandements of God, &amp; have the teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The former notes the life &amp; piety of the Saints conformable to the word of God: The latter the ſincerity of their faith ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenour of the Goſpel. So that theſe ſhould not pollute themſelves with the ſuperſtitions, idols &amp; abominations of Popery; but holily &amp; unblamably paſſe the time of their dwelling here, according to the rule of Gods law: neither ſhould they receive the traditions, lawes &amp; decrees of the Pope for articles of faith, but conſtantly maintain the ſincerity of Chriſtian belief: for the ſake wherof they were to undergoe the contradictions &amp; war of <hi>the Dragon</hi> through the <hi>Beaſt.</hi>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd I ſaw a Beast riſe up out of the ſea</hi>] In this part of the viſion there ſeems to all interpreters ſome barr to lie in the way touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this propheſie, as what ſhould be meant by theſe <hi>Beaſts,</hi> of both which Iohn at length cryes out, as if they were but one, <hi>here is wiſedome, let him that hath underſtanding count the number of the Beaſt:</hi> intimating, that here ſomething is figured out, paſſing the reach of man. And indeed the thing is ſo. Notwithſtanding from the manner of the method formerlie laid down by us, we may undoubtedly gather that the <hi>Third Ast</hi> of this 4 <hi>Viſion,</hi> that is, Antichriſtian perſecution is here repreſented.</p>
                     <p>Beſide I ſcarſly find any whether ancient or moderne interpreters (<hi>Lyra</hi> and <hi>Alcaſar</hi> excepted) but expound either the former, or the latter, or els both the Beaſts, of Antichriſt. Now, whatſoever is meant by the latter, let us firſt conſider the former.</p>
                     <p>Touching this I finde diverſe opinions.</p>
                     <p>Some will have it to be the divell.
<note place="margin">Opinions about this ſea-beaſt.</note> Others ſome certain and ſpecial perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in all manner of wickedneſſe, ſuch as <hi>Genſericus,</hi> or <hi>Coſroes,</hi> or his ſon <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes,</hi> or <hi>Mahumet:</hi> or <hi>Luther</hi> as <hi>Lindanus</hi> fooliſhly feigneth.</p>
                     <p>Others by <hi>the Beaſt</hi> underſtand the univerſality of wicked men.</p>
                     <p>But theſe opinions are not at all to bee eſteemed, becauſe indeed they mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly contradict the text. For the <hi>Dragon</hi> who is the devill ſhal give his throne unto the <hi>Beaſt.</hi> Therfore he is not the <hi>Beaſt</hi> himſelf. But in a prophetical ſtyle, a Beaſt in ſcripture uſually ſignifies not a ſpecial man, but a monarchical kingdome with the head thereof. Laſtly all the wicked ſhall follow and worſhip the <hi>Beaſt:</hi> therefore they themſelves are not the <hi>Beaſt.</hi> So that this <hi>Beaſt</hi> can neither bee reſtrained to one certain wicked man, nor confounded with all the wicked in generall.</p>
                     <p>But there are three other opinions more probable,
<note place="margin">Three opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions more probable.</note> which I wil briefly ſet down and examine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The firſt</hi> is, that this Beaſt denotes the old <hi>Romane Empire</hi> with its idolatrie &amp; cruelty againſt Chriſtians. Of this mind are many of the ancients, as <hi>Tertullian, Hierome, Oroſius, Euſebius,</hi> with many alſo of our latter divines, as <hi>Bullinger, Foxe, Oſiander</hi> in his conjectures, <hi>Junius, Aretius, Whitaker:</hi> wherin <hi>Alcaſar</hi> the Ieſuite agrees with them.
<note place="margin">1: <hi>ſentence touching the Romane empire ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined.</hi>
                        </note>
                     </p>
                     <p>This opinion howſoever I doe not altogether diſapprove: conſidering, that in <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. (where <hi>this Beaſt</hi> againe comes forth) it is manifeſt that Antichriſt clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with the ſpoiles of the <hi>Romane Empire,</hi> is repreſented by the ſame: never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe in this place I take it otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>firſt</hi> Iohn here ſees the <hi>beaſt ariſing out of the ſea.</hi> So that he ſaw its origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall: but the original of the Romane Empire he did not ſee. For it it had now already continued from <hi>Julius</hi> unto the fourteenth yeere of <hi>Domitian</hi> (when this propheſie was revealed unto him) CXLII <hi>yeeres.</hi> Therefore it is ſaid afterward in Chap. 17.8. of <hi>the Romane Empire: The Beaſt was,</hi> to wit, before this viſion, and before his riſing out of the ſea.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> this <hi>Beaſt</hi> roſe not out of <hi>the ſea,</hi> til the <hi>Womans flight into the wilderneſſe,</hi> as the order of the Viſion both here, and in the foregoing Chapter doth plainly
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:96676:166"/>manifeſt. Now <hi>the flight of the woman</hi> was not under the <hi>Romane tyrants,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gane under Chriſtian Emperours and hereticks, as we have ſhewed in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chapter.</p>
                     <p>Adde hereunto that <hi>the Beast</hi> is ſaid to rage <hi>fourty two moneths:</hi> the which is the time of the womans abode in the wilderneſſe, and the time of <hi>the propheſie of the two witneſſes,</hi> as appeares by what hath before bin ſpoken. Now this time by the conſent of all ſhall be the laſt, in which Antichriſt ſhall rage. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot poſſibly belong to the old or Pagan Empire of the Romanes.</p>
                     <p>To be ſhort, this ſeems to be a demonſtrative reaſon, that this Beaſt is often mentioned throughout this propheſie, as beeing to remain in a continuall perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Saintes unto the end of the world: and not to be <hi>aboliſhed but by the brightneſſe of Chriſts comming,</hi> who will <hi>cast him into the lake of fire and brimſtone,</hi> Chap. 19.10. Whereas <hi>the old Romane Empire</hi> ſcarſly dured three hundred and fifty four yeeres, and now hath bin in the hand of Chriſtians, thirteen hundred yeeres and more. Therefore this <hi>Beast</hi> cannot ſimply be applied to the ancient Romane Empire.</p>
                     <p>The reaſons moſt probable alledged for it (though of little ſolidity) are three:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> that this <hi>Beast</hi> ſeems to be like to the <hi>fourth beast</hi> in Daniel Chap. 7.7. by which, according to the common opinion, is denoted <hi>the Romane Monarchie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Romane Emperours</hi> from <hi>Tiberius</hi> unto <hi>Conſtantine</hi> have moſt cruelly warred againſt the Saintes, the which alſo <hi>the Beaſt</hi> is here ſaid to doe, ver. 7.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Laſtly,</hi> becauſe power is given to this <hi>Beaſt over every tribe and tongue &amp; nation,</hi> in the ſame verſe. The which moſt properly may be applied to <hi>the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,</hi> Lords of the world.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To the firſt,</hi> I anſwer: if we compare <hi>the Beaſt</hi> in Daniel with this here, we ſhal ſee indeed that both of them <hi>have ten hornes,</hi> but their likeneſſe in all other things is very obſcure: beſides <hi>the fourth Beaſt</hi> in Daniel is diverſe from all the other <hi>beaſts:</hi> but this here is as it were compounded of the three former <hi>Beaſts</hi> in Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel. Adde to this, that the Ancient Hebrewes with great ſhew of reaſon inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret <hi>the fourth Beaſt</hi> in Daniel, not of the Romane Empire, but of the kingdome of <hi>the Seleucides,</hi> of which <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> that <hi>little</hi> blaſphemous and cruell <hi>horne</hi> was chief: notwithſtanding I will not now diſpute what ſolidity there may be in it.</p>
                     <p>As for their ſecond reaſon, we have ſhewed that the perſecutions of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Dragons</hi> are repreſented in Chap. 12. But this <hi>warr of the Beaſt</hi> (farre more cruel) ſhall endure unto the end of the world, and not againſt the woman (which afterward he ſees riding <hi>on the ſcarlet coloured Beaſt</hi>) but with <hi>the ſeed of the woman,</hi> that is, with them who are truly faithfull.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To be ſhort,</hi> that the whole earth is ſaid <hi>to wonder, and follow after the Beast,</hi> v. 3. and to have <hi>power over all kinreds and tongues,</hi> &amp;c. v. 7. this is reſtrained to the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers on the earth &amp; reprobate worſhippers of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> in v. 8. Now not onely the reprobate gentiles were ſubject to the <hi>heatheniſh Romane Empire,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Apolog. c.</hi> 30 <hi>and ad Scapul. Mat.</hi> 17.27.</note> but the believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtians alſo, who (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> recordeth) worſhippped not <hi>the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours</hi> but God alone: And <hi>Paul</hi> to eſcape the fury of the Iewes appealed to Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar: Our Lord himſelf alſo paid tribute to the Romane Empire: And the Apoſtles taught Chriſtians to be obedient unto the Magiſtrates therof. In a word <hi>the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of the Beast</hi> imports not onely civil ſubjection, but religious worſhip, as we ſhall ſee hereafter. By all which it appeares that this <hi>Beast</hi> cannot be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely reſtrained to the Romane Empire: howſoever we may perceive that the monarchicall power of the Romane Empire is in ſome ſence taken up by the Beaſt, as may be gathered from Chap. 17.
<note place="margin">The ſecond opinion touching Mahumet weighed.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The other opinion (principally urged by <hi>Viterbienſis</hi>) is of thoſe, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this <hi>Beast</hi> of the Mahumetane or Turkiſh Empire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="284" facs="tcp:96676:167"/>
Theſe <hi>first</hi> conſider his riſing out of <hi>the ſea,</hi> that is, the gathering and joyning together of diverſe nations, as <hi>Arabians, Saracens, Turkes, Tartars,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly</hi> his figure. For hee is like a <hi>Leopard,</hi> becauſe he violently tooke into his hands the ſeat and power of the Graecian Monarchie, which Daniel likens unto a <hi>Leopard.</hi> He hath alſo <hi>the feet of a Beare:</hi> in regard he holds the pillars or props of the Perſian Monarchy, the which is alſo there compared unto <hi>a Beare:</hi> he hath moreover <hi>the mouth of a Lyon:</hi> becauſe he poſſeſſeth the ſpoiles of the firſt Aſſyrian Monarchie.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>the Mahumetane Empire</hi> is extended in religion and worſhip over all theſe peoples: in regard both <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Babylonians</hi> are at this day <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metanes,</hi> though under diverſe kings. It is alſo ful of blaſphemies againſt the God of Iſrael, and againſt the Son of God. The <hi>Mahumetanes power</hi> is terrible and invincible: and hath more then nine hundred yeeres moſt cruelly warred againſt the Saintes and worſhippers of Chriſt: and ſo overcome, as that all <hi>Aſia,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt <hi>Africa</hi> with a great part of <hi>Europe</hi> (beeing wrung out of the hands of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians) is brought under the religion and power of <hi>Mahumet:</hi> and Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion forced into the outmoſt corners of <hi>Europe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lastly,</hi> the time of <hi>the fourty two moneths</hi> deſigned to the reigne and rage of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> may wel and fitly be applied to the violent rage of the <hi>Mahumetanes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now however indeed theſe things have a great ſhew of ſeeming truth: yet they are not ſolid.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>firſt this riſing out of the ſea,</hi> is rather to be underſtood of a coming forth out of <hi>the bottomleſſe pit,</hi> then of a gathering of Barbarous nations, as by and by it ſhall appear.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> the figure taken from the members of diverſe Beaſts doth alſo admit of a more fit interpretation. So alſo the <hi>blasphemies,</hi> and the large and terrible powr are more rightly to bee applied to the <hi>Romane Antichriſt</hi> then to the Turke: although he alſo doth in a verie hoſtile manner act the parts of <hi>the Eaſterne An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt</hi> againſt the Chriſtian Church, as appeared in the <hi>ſixt trumpet,</hi> Chap. 9.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Laſily,</hi> the time of <hi>the fourty two moneths,</hi> doth altogether agree to the warre of <hi>the Romane Beaſt</hi> againſt <hi>the two witneſſes,</hi> as hath bin ſhewed on Chap. 11. Thus wee ſee that the foreſaid reaſons doe not ſufficiently confirme this ſecond opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
                     <p>Moreover there are two things which doe plainely diſprove the ſame: <hi>One is,</hi> in that it is often ſaid: this <hi>Beaſt was wondred at, and worſhipped by the inhabitants of the earth,</hi> the which (as I have ſhewed) ſignifies not ſimply a ſubjection, but a religious worſhip given unto the <hi>Beaſt:</hi> now this doth not ſo wel agree to the <hi>Turkiſh Empire:</hi> for although <hi>the Turkes</hi> worſhip <hi>Mahumet</hi> as the greateſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: yet they attribute no religious worſhip unto their Emperours: neither doe they ſubject themſelves unto their Empire ſo much thorow admiration, as for feare. <hi>The other</hi> is taken from Chap. 17. where it is manifeſt that this ſame <hi>Beaſt</hi> appears againe unto <hi>John</hi> a woman ſitting thereon. Now there <hi>the ſeven heads of the Beaſt,</hi> are <hi>the ſeven mountaines of Rome,</hi> and <hi>the woman</hi> herſelf denotes Rome, the which is ſo evident as it cannot be denied, no not by ſome of the Ieſuites them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Therefore this <hi>Beaſt</hi> hath his ſeat at Rome: But <hi>the Turke</hi> never had his ſeat there: hence then it ſeemes that this <hi>Beaſt</hi> doth not belong unto the <hi>Turkiſh Empire:</hi> unleſſe perhaps it yet come to paſſe that <hi>Italie</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> fall into the hands of the Turke: the which thing God knoweth. Indeed the horrible <hi>Idol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip of Rome</hi> may juſtly procure ſuch a judgement: notwithſtanding the holy Ghoſt threatens in <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.16. that the Romiſh harlot ſhall be deſtroyed and burnt with fire, not by <hi>the Turke,</hi> but by <hi>ten kings,</hi> ſometimes her lovers and frindes.</p>
                     <p>I come unto the third opinion,
<note place="margin">The third opinion.</note> which is that this <hi>Beaſt</hi> is <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> The which not onely many ancient writers as <hi>Irenaeus, Ambroſe, Prosper, Methodius, Arethas, Andreas,</hi> &amp;c. But alſo ſundrie moderne both Papiſts and proteſtants
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:96676:167"/>have followed: as <hi>Gagneus, Bellarmin, Ribera:</hi> and of ours <hi>Alphonſus, Morellus, Toſſanus:</hi> with whom my <hi>Anonymus</hi> alſo conſents.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alcaſar</hi> indeed likes it not, becauſe he ſees that it cannot conſiſt with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fable touching Antichriſt his three yeares reigne: And becauſe he feineth that after the deſtruction of the beaſt, there ſhall be thouſand years of peace: and hence therefore he doth juſtly reprove and reprehend as well the old as latter Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours and maintainers of the ſaid fable. But he is deceived touching the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares of peace to follow after the deſtruction of the Beaſt, as I ſhall mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt on chap. 20. But his caveat is good: <hi>that it is not enough for the approving of an expoſition as certaine and not to be doubted of, becauſe many ſubſcribe unto it.</hi> Whoſoever therefore the authours be, their reaſons are to be examined. Firſt,
<note place="margin">The third opinion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and proved.</note> this <hi>Beast</hi> doth very well agree with the <hi>little horne</hi> in <hi>Daniel,</hi> cha. 7.8. which ſignifies either Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt himſelf, or at leaſt is a type of him, as the moſt learned Chriſtian interpreters do acknowledge: for what <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeaks of the <hi>little horne, Iohn</hi> doth almoſt in ſo many words aſcribe unto this <hi>Beaſt:</hi> that he hath <hi>a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies:</hi> that he <hi>makes warre with the Saints, and overcomes them,</hi> and that for the ſpace <hi>of fourty two moneths,</hi> or <hi>for a time, times, and halfe a time, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, this Beaſt riſing out of the Sea, and that in chap. 11, <hi>aſcending out of the bottomleſſe pit,</hi> are undoubtedly one: becauſe the figure and time of wrath and warre doth agree: and that it is one, not onely <hi>Arethas</hi> and <hi>Andreas,</hi> but alſo <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymus, Ribera,</hi> and <hi>Gagneus</hi> do acknowledge, <hi>viz.</hi> that Antichriſt. Furthermore this ſevenheaded Beaſt, and the <hi>Beaſt on which the woman ſits,</hi> chap. 17. is one and the ſame altogether, as the deſcription ſhews, and ſhall more plainly appeare after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Now the Beaſt there v. 11. without all doubt (though in a great myſtery) denotes Antichriſt with his kingdom and ſeat: and therefore the <hi>Beaſt</hi> here is to be underſtood of him alſo.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, the attributes of this Beaſt agree to none more evidently, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Antichriſt, Firſt in this, that the <hi>whole earth with admiration followed the Beaſt,</hi> the which thing is moſt true, for the whole Chriſtian world readily indeed honoureth Antichriſt, as <hi>ſitting in the temple of God, boaſting himſelfe that he is God,</hi> and holineſſe it ſelf. Now the <hi>Romanes</hi> heretofore did hardly with great force of armes ſubject the world under their power. And as for the <hi>Mahumetanes</hi> hitherto they have enlarged their Empire onely by ſlaughters and effuſion of much blood.</p>
                     <p>Moreover it accords in this, that <hi>on his heads he had a name of blasphemy, and with his mouth he speaketh great and blaspemous things.</hi> Now howbeit it is true, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> and <hi>Turkiſh Empire</hi> ever hath been, and ſtill is very blaſphemous: yet the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> were, and the <hi>Turks</hi> ſtill are blaſphemers without the Church, and ignorant of God and Chriſt; as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of himſelfe what he did when he was a Phariſee: But Antichriſt <hi>ſitting in the Church of God,</hi> under the name of Chriſt, grievouſly blaſphemeth the ſame: and will be accounted by his followers a god, yea moſt proudly <hi>lifts himſelfe up above all that is called god.</hi> It is true the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Domitian</hi> were ſometime ſo athiſtically mad, as that they would be divinely worſhipped. But that was nothing in compariſon of Antichriſts arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy, <hi>whoſe footſteps are adored by Kings and Emperours.</hi> Againe in this likewiſe the agreement ſtands, that <hi>he makes warre with the Saints:</hi> the which thing I grant that the <hi>Romanes and Turks have alſo done:</hi> But <hi>Antichriſts warre with the Saints</hi> by the confeſſion of all men ſhall be far more curſed and cruell: for it ſhall not be a civill warre onely, as in killing the body, and confiſcating the eſtates of men: but a ſpirituall likewiſe, <hi>ſelling, tormenting, and killing of ſoules.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, it agrees, <hi>that he hath power over every nation, kindred and tongues:</hi> it is true the <hi>Romanes</hi> did very farre enlarge the bounds of their Empire, that ſo they might be the Lords of the world: The Mahumetanes alſo Lord it far and neare, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the limits of the Church: But <hi>Antichriſt ſitting in the temple of God,</hi> ſo far forth as the <hi>temple of God,</hi> or Chriſtian Church did viſibly appeare, ſhould under the pretence of religion uſurpe the Empire as <hi>Monarch,</hi> and <hi>Head</hi> of all. All which
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:96676:168"/>things conſidered, I ſuppoſe that the third opinion touching the <hi>Beaſt-Antichriſt</hi> is ſufficiently confirmed. Notwithſtanding, if theſe things are not fully ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to any: ſuch then I onely deſire that they will reſt in the reaſons laid down, untill they heare <hi>Iohn</hi> himſelfe in Chap. 17. give the interpretation of this myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. For from that fountain the ſence of this place is to be drawn, howſoever thoſe interpreters ſeem to me inconſiderate, who apply all the myſteries of that place to this here, for they ought to obſerve, that the ſpirit doth purpoſely and in great wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom produce this monſtre in foure diſtinct viſions, (<hi>viz.</hi> the third, fourth, fift, and ſixt) acting or ſuffering diverſe and different things, that the former things may the more clearly be known by the latter.</p>
                     <p>And hitherto indeed ſuch of the Papiſts agree with our interpreters,
<note place="margin">Who Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt ſhould be, queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned betwixt us and the Papiſts. The Papiſts deſcription of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</note> who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge <hi>Antichrist</hi> to be noted by this <hi>Beaſt</hi> whither wholly conſidered, or in one of his heads.</p>
                     <p>But we diſagree in judgement about the queſtion, <hi>who is that Antichriſt figured out by this Beaſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Papiſts (that the Pope might not be ſuſpected to be he) feign ſuch an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt (as we have more then once before ſpoken of: to wit) a certaine <hi>Jew</hi> begot by an evill ſpirit, and to be borne of a Iewiſh woman near the end of the world: whom the Iews ſhall acknowledge for their <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and who (as they ſay) in the ſpace of <hi>three years and ſix moneths</hi> ſhall ſubdue all the kingdoms of the world, yea the Romane Empire alſo (but yet not take up the title of a Romane Emperor) ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the whole earth, rebuild the temple of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> ſit and reign there: he ſhall reſtore <hi>Rome,</hi> which ten Kings (having thruſt out the Pope) had burnt with fire, there he ſhall reign and literally fulfill all things which here are recorded of both Beaſts. Touching the vanity of which fabulous opinion (which al may ſee was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for the deſtruction of the Chriſtian world) we have ſpoken enough before on Chap. 9. and 11.</p>
                     <p>Our Divines on the contrary affirme,
<note place="margin">Antichriſt deſcribed by the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</note> that no man is more evidently repreſented by this moſt monſtrous Beaſt then the Papall Empire or Pope of Rome: of whom <hi>Alphonſus Mantuanus</hi> thus writeth: <hi>Iohn</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>being to deſcribe Antichriſts rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous extortion, &amp; venemous rage againſt the godly, types him out under the monſtrous image of a horrible Beaſt, which neither could be termed a Lyon, or a Beare, or any ſuch like crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but one in whom was conteined the fierceneſſe of all wilde beasts. By this Beaſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Antichriſt is undoubtedly to be underſtood: whenſoever then Antichriſt is mentioned, we need not ſeek him in</hi> Babilon, <hi>but in the head of the fourth Monarchie, to wit, at</hi> Rome, <hi>&amp;c. Furthermore, I ſee not who he ſhould be, ſave the Pope, whoſe kingdom and tyranny if we compare with the things spoken in</hi> Daniel <hi>of the little horn, it will abundantly appeare, that it is be who fully acts all the parts of Antichriſt, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This opinion ſeems indeed to <hi>Alcaſar</hi> to be fooliſh and vain:
<note place="margin">Alcaſars reaſons an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> but not ſo unto us in the leaſt, but rather he himſelf is ridiculous in deceiving both himſelf and others by his idle and fooliſh reaſons. <hi>Jt is apparent</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the Popes authority, is founded, ſtabliſhed, and erected by Christ our Lord.</hi> As if forſooth whatſoever ſeemes right and apparent to them, muſt needs be true &amp; certain. What I pray you is more apparent, then that the Prieſthood of <hi>Aaron</hi> was appointed of God? And yet was not <hi>Cayphas</hi> the high Prieſt his Succeſſour a wicked murtherer of Chriſt? Beſides the ancient Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> were not guilty of that filthineſſe and corruption, with which afterward the ſucceeding Popes having invaded the <hi>Chaire of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall peſtilence,</hi> defiled the ſea of Rome.</p>
                     <p>Further, he feigneth, that if the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> be this <hi>Beaſt,</hi> then the Divel made war againſt the Church by the miniſtery of the <hi>Romiſh Popes</hi> immediately when (the Iews ceaſing) the Gentiles became the Church. But the conſequence which he ſuppoſeth, is falſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that the transferring of the Church unto the Gentiles is not deſcribed till in Ch. 12. for what was the <hi>treading down of the holy city by the Gentiles,</hi> before treated of in Ch. 11? Wherefore it certainly follows, that the <hi>Romane Popes</hi> by the inſtigation of the <hi>Dragon</hi> made war againſt the Church <hi>troaden down by the
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:96676:168"/>Gentiles,</hi> that is, as <hi>Ribera</hi> interprets it, by Antichriſt and his miniſters.</p>
                     <p>But ſaith he, <hi>it is altogether improbable that the Revelation ſhould omit to mention that moſt cruel war, by which the idolatrous Romane Emperors oppreſſed the Chriſtian Church, together with that moſt glorious victory, wherein the Church obtained; notwithſtanding the perſecution of the Romane Empire.</hi> I confeſſe it is improbable. But <hi>Alcaſar</hi> might have learned from the foregoing <hi>war of Michael with the Dragon,</hi> that neither this <hi>war</hi> was omitted, nor the victory paſſed by in ſilence, if he would wipe off from his eyes the diſeaſe occaſioned by his own fooliſh conſequence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> he objects, that the <hi>fourth Beaſt</hi> in <hi>Daniel</hi> figures out, not the Pope, but the <hi>heathen Romane Empire.</hi> But this hath been anſwered in what we ſpake unto the firſt opinion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Laſtly,</hi> he ſaith that the deſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the <hi>Sea beaſt</hi> cannot but with contradiction be applyed unto the Pope. But the reaſon thereof is, becauſe he diſdaines out of a <hi>Spaniſh pride,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Alcaſar <hi>ſtrongly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes the hereticks by hear-ſay.</hi>
                        </note> to read what hath been publiſhed hereabout by the authours of the ſaid opinion: for this ſubtile man acknowledgeth, <hi>that he knows nothing but by heare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay, and refutes the hereticks by the report he hath heard.</hi> But he ſhould have learned ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to believe his eyes then eares, and ſo doing, he would have made the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter application. Thus I have expounded the moſt probable opinions of others touching this <hi>Sea-Beaſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now for my own part,
<note place="margin">The authors opinion.</note> I conceive that neither the <hi>firſt</hi> touching the <hi>Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> nor the <hi>third</hi> concerning the <hi>Romane Antichriſt</hi> is ſimply to be approved or diſproved, but that in a certain ſence, both are to be joyned together.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt</hi> therefore I take it undoubtedly (ſeeing it is uſuall to the Prophets under the type of a <hi>Beaſt</hi> enigmatically to figure out Empires and Monarchicall kingdoms, becauſe of their violence, cruelty, and other horrible exceſſe) that by this <hi>Beast</hi> is alſo noted ſome certain Monarchicall Empire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſuppoſe the thing it ſelf makes it clear, as in its place ſhall be ſhewed, that this and the <hi>ſeven headed beaſt</hi> mentioned Cha. 17. is one and the ſame, and that the <hi>ſeven mountaines,</hi> ſignifie <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I affirme with the foreſaid interpreters, that this <hi>Beaſt,</hi> as hath been even now proved, ſignifies Antichriſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Lib.</hi> 8 <hi>in Apoc. Bel. lib. de R. P. C.</hi> 25.</note> (with <hi>Rupertus</hi> &amp; <hi>Bellarmin</hi>) I judge that the ſame <hi>Antichriſt</hi> in a diverſe regard is figured out by both <hi>Beaſts. The Beaſt</hi> (ſaith <hi>Rupertus</hi>) <hi>is ſaid to be twofold, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his double,</hi> viz. <hi>warlike,</hi> or <hi>Kingly and magicall force:</hi> Or as Bellarmin: <hi>By the one, Antichriſt is expreſſed, in regard of his kingly power and tyranny: But by the other, in regard of his magicall art, by which he ſubtilly ſeduceth men:</hi> More rightly according to <hi>Revel.</hi> cha. 13. by <hi>one</hi> is meant his tyranny: by the <hi>other</hi> his deceit and ſeducing: for which cauſe afterward he is often called a <hi>falſe prophet:</hi> And ſo ch. 17. he is again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by this <hi>Beaſt</hi> as a Monarch: and by the <hi>woman riding thereon,</hi> as a <hi>Queen,</hi> or <hi>ſeducing Church. Fiftly,</hi> I conclude, that Antichriſt is figured out by a <hi>double beaſt,</hi> and by his twofold riſing out of the <hi>ſea</hi> &amp; <hi>earth,</hi> as it were living on the land &amp; ſea, having two bodies, two ſhapes, &amp; a twofold nature, in a certain likenes to Chriſt: here indeed as a ſecular Monarch and eccleſiaſticall ſeducer: but afterward as the Romane Monarch and adulterous Church. <hi>Sixtly,</hi> I conclude, that neither the old nor the new <hi>Romane Empire</hi> ſimply, nor the <hi>Romiſh prelateſhip</hi> is abſolutely repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by this <hi>beaſt</hi> (for abſolutely neither the one nor other is Antichriſt) but that <hi>Romane Pontificall Empire</hi> and authority, which the <hi>Popes of Rome</hi> have exerciſed theſe many ages. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> I conclude, that this <hi>double bodied</hi> and <hi>faced Antichriſt</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving both on the <hi>land</hi> and <hi>ſea,</hi> ſignified by both the beaſts is none other but the <hi>Romiſh Pope,</hi> clothed with the ſpoiles of the Romane Monarchie, and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Vicarſhip</hi> of Chriſt, and armed with the <hi>ſword of Paul,</hi> and <hi>key of Peter,</hi> that is, with both powers: The <hi>Temporall</hi> to ſet up and put downe Emperours and Kings, &amp;c. The <hi>Spirituall</hi> to give Lawes both to them in heaven, on earth, and under the earth: that <hi>Antichriſt, I ſay,</hi> who firſt under the figure of a <hi>Sea-beaſt,</hi> preſently after under the figure of a <hi>land-beaſt</hi> doth
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:96676:169"/>here come forth on the theatre, who one while is cloathed in his pontificals, an other while comes armed into the councell with imperiall enſignes, ſaying <hi>I am Caeſar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is my opinion of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> who is here ſo evidently figured out by the <hi>ſeven-headed beaſt,</hi> and fained likeneſſe to the Lamb: and afterward <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. by the <hi>ſeven-headed beaſt and woman riding thereon:</hi> that no man, unleſſe he willingly ſhut his eyes againſt the light, cannot but perceive the ſame. This light our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod brings to al (who without it are in darknes) the which henceforward we will labour to illuſtrate by our interpretation unto Gods glory.</p>
                     <p>But thou wilt ſay,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>See Ver.</hi> 18</note> wherfore then doth not John expreſſely name the Pope or Antichriſt? becauſe here he ſtands not in the place of a teacher, but of a Prophet. Teachers indeed are to expreſſe things plainly: but Prophets foretelling things to come eſpecially of dangerous conſequence, (ſet them forth under dark and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure types:) hereby to ſtir men up to the more diligent ſearching out of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents: and to ſhun unneceſſary diſpleaſure. <hi>Iohn</hi> in his Epiſtles, where he onely teacheth and exhorteth the Church, often names <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and bids us avoid him. But here as a Prophet he paints out his perſon and kingdome, under the type of a <hi>Beaſt:</hi> and thence would have us to judge of the myſtery thereof. So <hi>Paul</hi> Propheſying of Antichriſt, purpoſely abſtains from naming him, yet ſets him forth in ſuch lively colours, that whoſoever looks but on the <hi>Romiſh Prelacie,</hi> may plainly ſee, who, and what manner of perſon he is.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And I ſaw a beaſt riſing out of the ſea</hi>] We have heard who this beaſt is. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth now touching his <hi>riſing;</hi> he <hi>aſcends out of the ſea.</hi> Before in <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.7. and afterward Chap. 17.8. <hi>he aſcends out of the bottomleſſe pit:</hi> the ſenſe is all one; for the <hi>ſea</hi> alſo in Scripture is called <hi>abyſſus,</hi> becauſe of its deepneſſe; See <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.1. The prepoſition OF, may as well note the place, as the beginning, whence the <hi>beaſt</hi> derived his originall, and received his power.</p>
                     <p>Vnderſtanding it originally of the place:
<note place="margin">The ſea out of which the beaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth.</note> by the <hi>ſea</hi> then is meant, the <hi>infernall bottomleſſe pit,</hi> or the throne and kingdome of Satan; Whence alſo the <hi>Locuſts</hi> came forth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.13. for Antichriſt is the <hi>Angel of the bottomleſſe pit, whoſe comming is after the working of Satan, with all deceitfulneſſe of unrighteouſneſſe, lying ſignes and wonders.</hi> So that theſe places do excellently expound themſelves. For <hi>the Beaſt</hi> in this place <hi>riſing out of the ſea: and out of the bottomleſſe pit,</hi> Chap. 11.8. and 17.8. is <hi>the Angel of the bottomleſſe pit,</hi> Chap. 9.11. <hi>Whoſe comming is after the power of Satan,</hi> 2. Theſſ. 2.9. and to whom here, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. the <hi>Dragone gave his throne and power:</hi> All which things ſhew, that <hi>Antichrist</hi> is raiſed up by Satan and armed with his power.</p>
                     <p>But if we underſtand it of the matter from whence he took his originall or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning (like as a living creature is begotten of ſeed, or as trees grow from the root) in this ſence the <hi>ſea</hi> is nothing elſe but that <hi>flood</hi> which the <hi>Dragon cast forth out of his mouth after the woman,</hi> Chap. 12.16. that is, the ſinke of Hereſies, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, traditions, ſuperſtitions, and all other abominations which increaſing in the Church, the ſincerity of faith, and purity of Chriſtian religion was corrupted and depraved, the Church forced to flee into the wilderneſſe, Chriſt thruſt out of his poſſeſſion, and Antichriſt ſet up in his ſtead.</p>
                     <p>But here ſome may ſay,
<note place="margin">How the beaſt aroſe out of the ſea.</note> how could Antichriſt ariſe out of the dregs of the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies of <hi>Arius, Macedonius, Neſtorius, Eutyches, Pelagius, Coeleſtius, Julian,</hi> &amp;c. Seing it is certain that thoſe hereſies were chiefly condemned by the <hi>Romane Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was ſo indeed: nevertheleſſe Satan through <hi>Synods</hi> condemning hereſies, did ſubtilly and ſecretly work <hi>the myſterie of iniquity.</hi> For under pretence of rooting out hereſies, almoſt yeerly, yea monethly theſe councils like ſeas flowing together, continually deviſed new laws, rites, forms, creeds, &amp;c. inſomuch as it came to be a proverb that Chriſtians had a <hi>monthly faith.</hi> Now with the new forms of faith, were forged new canons of erecting &amp; purifying temples, conſecrating altars, of ſeats &amp;
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:96676:169"/>chief places, of orders, garments, immunities, powers, priviledges, and rents of praelates and prieſts, of eſtabliſhing and encreaſing of the clergie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Who though they were all alike ambitious and covetous, in affecting power over each other, <hi>as the Romane over the Constantinopolitane,</hi> he over the <hi>Alexandrine,</hi> the <hi>Alexandrine</hi> againe over the <hi>Antiochian,</hi> and this later over him of Ieruſalem: yet at length the Romane praelates under the favour of the emperours and primacie of their citie, together with the pretence of the <hi>Peters chair, keys, and vicarſhip of Christ</hi> overcame all other in ambition and power.</p>

                     <p>Our Interpreters, who underſtand this <hi>Beast</hi> of the old Romane Empire, do all agree that here is noted ſome remarkable weakning thereof: but others apply it otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>Some underſtand the <hi>one head</hi> of <hi>Julius Ceſar</hi> the firſt Emperour, who being ſlaine, the Empire received a deadly wound: but was healed again by <hi>Auguſtus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Others referre it to the death of <hi>Nero,</hi> in whom the family of <hi>Caeſars</hi> ceaſed: and then the Empire ſeemed to be near a diſſipation, when in a few moneths after were ſlaine three Emperours, <hi>viz. Galba, Ottho,</hi> and <hi>Vitelius:</hi> yet this <hi>wound was healed</hi> by <hi>Veſpaſian, whom the Common-wealth of Rome</hi> (as <hi>Aurelius Victor</hi> reports) being almoſt ſpent by the cruelty of tyrants, obteined by a providence for their Emperour after LVI. yeares, that it might not utterly be ruinated. But theſe <hi>wounds</hi> were before <hi>Johns</hi> time, whereas here he propheſieth of the <hi>Beaſts wounded</hi> afterward.</p>
                     <p>Others underſtand it of the ſciſme of the Romane Monarchie under <hi>Heraclius,</hi> occaſioned by <hi>Mahumet</hi> in the Eaſt, and the <hi>Pope</hi> in the Weſt, by which diviſion the Romane Empire was ſo ſhaken, as it had much adoe to ſubſiſt: the which wound they conceive was again healed by <hi>Charles the great.</hi> But we have ſhewed before, that the Beaſt or Antichriſt doth not here abſolutely denote the Romane Empire.</p>
                     <p>Now whatſoever this be (we may wel referre it till we come to Ch. 17. v. 11.) yet here we muſt conſider, what is meant by the <hi>Beaſts deadly wound,</hi> and what
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:96676:171"/>by the healing thereof. Concerning which, although our Interpreters (who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the Beaſt to be Antichriſt) doe not preciſely agree in every thing: yet hence the Papiſts have no cauſe to inſult. For the verity of our tenet, <hi>viz. that the Pope is Antichriſt,</hi> may firmely ſtand, although it be not ſo eaſie to define all the particulars of this myſtery, (for Hiſtories teſtifie that the <hi>Beaſts head</hi> hath already been diverſly wounded) or know to what mortall wound of Antichriſt the holy Ghoſt here properly points at.

                        </note> that this <hi>wound</hi> is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred <hi>to the ſacking of Rome by the Barbarians:</hi> of which ſee <hi>Sabellicus.</hi> For who doubts but that the <hi>ſeventh head of the Beaſt</hi> was then wounded unto death, when <hi>Rome</hi> being forſaken of her Emperours (who retired to <hi>Bizantium</hi> in the Eaſt, or to <hi>Ravenna</hi> in Italie) was overwhelmed under the new government of Popes with that great tempeſt or irruption of the <hi>Gothes, Vandals,</hi> and the <hi>Hunni,</hi> &amp;c. By which the whole Weſt was moſt miſerable afflicted, and <hi>Rome</hi> well nie wholly brought to nothing. For within the ſpace of XLII. yeares, it was five times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, taken and ſpoiled by the Barbarians, inſomuch as ſometime for fourty dayes there was found in the City neither man nor woman. <hi>Adolphus</hi> King of the <hi>Gothes</hi> alſo determined to alter the name thereof, and inſtead of <hi>Rome</hi> to call it <hi>Gothia.</hi> Who would not have thought that then there had been an end of the <hi>Popes ſeat</hi> and kingdom in <hi>Italie:</hi> notwithſtanding this <hi>wound was healed</hi> by little and little, firſt by <hi>Iuſtinian the Emperour,</hi> who ſending <hi>Beliſarius</hi> and afterward <hi>Narſes</hi> with an armie, rooted the <hi>Gothes</hi> out of <hi>Italy,</hi> reſtored the Pope to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer place, and enlarged his dignity and power. For when the <hi>Conſtantinopolitane</hi> and he of <hi>Alexandria</hi> affected the Primacie, as thinking that <hi>Rome</hi> was now wholy brought under, the Emperour gave forth a new conſtitution, ſaying, <hi>We decree, and will according to the Decrees of the holy Synods, that the moſt holy Biſhop of ancient Rome be the chiefe of all Prieſis.</hi> Afterward <hi>Phocas</hi> fully <hi>healed the wound,</hi> attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to <hi>Boniface III.</hi> not onely to be accounted the chief, but <hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>This interpretation of <hi>Brightman</hi> I ſhould follow, but that he doth two much anticipate the <hi>wound</hi> and the healing thereof. For he makes the <hi>Beast to be woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> before he was fully manifeſted, for he was not as yet aſcended out of the ſea into the Chaire of <hi>Vniverſall pestilence,</hi> untill <hi>Boniface III.</hi> and therefore could not be <hi>wounded</hi> and <hi>healed</hi> before his riſing.</p>
                     <p>Leaving therefore the opinions of others, I will here propound two things.

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> there is in this ſtroke and healing, an <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, as we obſerved in <hi>the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans flight,</hi> namely, how that is firſt related, which hapned after. For the <hi>Beaſt</hi> was not preſenly wounded and <hi>healed</hi> ſo ſoon as he roſe, or was ſet on his throne, but ſome while after: Neither did the whole earth then begin to admire and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Beaſt upon his wounding and healing: and when he blaſphemed God and made war with the Saints: but immediately, or ſo ſoone as he received his <hi>throne and power from the Dragon:</hi> which indeed evidently proves the anticipation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> ſeeing it is not expeſſed by whom the mortall wound was inflicted, neither by whom <hi>healed,</hi> we are therefore to conceive that it was inflicted and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine healed, either by the <hi>Dragon,</hi> as not being able (as it were) to indure the pride of the <hi>Beaſt:</hi> Or elſe by the Lord, provoked to wrath, but healed again by the <hi>ſecond Beast.</hi> For the <hi>wound of the ſword,</hi> as it is called, ver. 14. ſignifies not a <hi>wound</hi> willingly made, but inflicted by ſome other. Now it could not be inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> unleſſe either the <hi>Dragon</hi> did it (as being more powerfull then he)
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:96676:172"/>or the Lord. For touching all others his admirers cry out v. 4. <hi>Who is able to fight with the beast.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If we take it in the former ſence, I finde not when the <hi>head of the beaſt ſitting on his throne,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The capital ſciſme of Popes.</note> was more grievouſly wounded then by that deadlie ſciſme of Popes, wherewith the Papacie was afflicted more then fourty yeeres, <hi>viz.</hi> from the yeere 1378. unto the <hi>Council of Conſtance,</hi> when almoſt <hi>Antichriſts</hi> kingdom was wholie ruinated by the diſcords of the Antipopes, occaſioned by the <hi>Dragon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For when <hi>Clement</hi> V. <hi>a Gaſcon,</hi> removed the Romane court to <hi>Avinion in France,</hi> where it remained <hi>Eightie three yeeres, Gregorie</hi> XI. indeed recalled the Papal ſeat from thence to Rome: but beeing dead, the Romanes choſe <hi>Vrbane</hi> VI. for their Pope, whom the <hi>Italians, Germanes,</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> followed, and he ſate at <hi>Rome.</hi> On the contrary, the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> created <hi>Clement</hi> VII. for their Antipope, and he remained at <hi>Avinion:</hi> who being dead the ſciſme was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued by new <hi>Antipopes, viz.

But if ſo be we are to underſtand the <hi>wound and the healing</hi> thereof in the latter ſence:
<note place="margin">Alphonſus his opinion touching the deadly wound of the Beaſt.</note> then I ſhould altogether embrace the opinion of <hi>Alphonſus Mantuanus,</hi> a learned Italian Interpreter. <hi>One of the Beasts heads</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as it were wounded to death, ſeemes to me to denote that age of impiety, in which the Gospell began to be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and the Popiſh kingdom oppoſed through the miniſtery of the Gospell, and the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination thereof ſo manifeſted, as it is even known to the ignorant themſelves, that the Pope who hath on his heads written names of blaſphemy, is the Beaſt, and a moſt wretched man, who preſumes to be esteemed a god. For then the Beaſt was ſeen to have received a deadly wound, when thoſe impious doctrines, by which hitherto the Popes kingdome hath remained in its strength, were reproved as meere lyes, and Diabolicall deceits, by the free preaching of the Goſpell of Christ.</hi> Thus far he.</p>
                     <p>By the <hi>mortall wound of the Beast</hi> therefore he underſtands the ſeparation of the Profeſſours of the Goſpell from Popery, whence firſt a deadly diſeaſe befell the Papiſts in <hi>Germany,</hi> and ſoon after in the neighbouring Kingdoms of <hi>France, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Hungary,</hi> and <hi>England:</hi> Like as the ach of a wound ordinarily is irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to the parts adjoyning. This <hi>wound</hi> could not be inflicted on this <hi>powerfull Beast,</hi> but by God himſelf, who at laſt taking compaſſion on <hi>Germanie,</hi> confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the deceits of <hi>Rome,</hi> by rayſing up <hi>Anno</hi> 1516. <hi>Luther, Melancthon,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther excellent Divines, as the inſtruments and organes of his grace and favour. The <hi>ſword wounding the Beaſt,</hi> was the preaching of the Goſpell, by which in a ſhort ſpace the props of Popery were ſo ſore ſhaken throughout <hi>Germany,</hi> as it was not far from an utter ruine.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding our ſins ſo deſerving, we ſee this wound now healed, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie again prevailing, and reaſſuming her ſtrength and vigour. But by what medicines or potions? This is cleared by Hiſtories: And as <hi>Alphonſus</hi> well wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, this deadly ſtroke began to be healed: <hi>When the Kings and Princes of the earth, began through fire and ſword to force men unto the Popes obedience.</hi> To this end was raiſed the <hi>Smalcaldick war</hi> againſt the Proteſtants: The wars of the Spaniard in the Low-countries, and the <hi>Maſſacres in France,</hi> that the <hi>mortall ſtroke of the Beaſt might be healed:</hi> But the falſe prophet ver. 11. ſeems to have made the true medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,
<note place="margin">The Beaſts Chyrurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> by his Chyrurgians, <hi>Campegius, Caietane, Polus, Faber, Prierates, Eckius, Latomus, Staphylus,</hi> and the like Phyſicians, who excelling in art, fraud and ſophiſtrie, have held up the tottering ſtate of the Papacy: Notwithſtanding the <hi>Councill of Trent</hi> acted the part of <hi>chiefe Phyſicians,</hi> as applying with great skill wonderfull potions for to heal this wound. To theſe we may adde the <hi>Popiſh Academies,</hi> and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that of the <hi>Sorbonniſts</hi> at <hi>Paris.</hi> The laſt are the <hi>jugling Ieſuites,</hi> by whoſe induſtrie, boldneſſe and craft, the <hi>Head of the Beaſt</hi> is daily more and more reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to its former health. And I could wiſh that the unhappy contentions of the Profeſſours of the Goſpell were not as oyle and wine powred into this wound: for I verily believe, that our own diſſentions have more ſtrengthened the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> then all his own force and policy whatſoever. Thus much concerning the <hi>wound, and the healing</hi> thereof.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And all the whole earth wondred after the Beast</hi>] Firſt, I deſire the reader to take notice of the anticipation even now laid down. For we are not to think that the world <hi>admired not the Beaſt till he was wounded and healed again:</hi> for the <hi>Beast</hi> never was without his followers, and people <hi>wondring at his throne, and great power:</hi> and therefore by way of a <hi>parentheſis,</hi> the ſtroke and cure was ſpoken of before, which came to paſſe afterward. Now <hi>the authority of the Beaſt,</hi> and the beſotted ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of men to worſhip him, doth immediately cohere with his <hi>ſeat</hi> and <hi>great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:</hi> for although this be not ſo plaine in the verſe, yet is it clear by the following: For wherefore is the <hi>Beaſt</hi> ſo much wondred at? was it becauſe he was healed? certainly it is a matter of no great admiration that a wound ſhould be cured by a Chyrurgian: and therefore this cure could not be the cauſe of ſo great an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as the Gloſſe imagineth, in applying it to the feined death and reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Antichriſt: the which thing even the chiefeſt of the Ieſuites are aſhamed of.
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:96676:173"/>The true cauſe of the <hi>worlds wondring,</hi> is the <hi>ſeat and great power given to the Beast by the Dragon:</hi> as we ſhall ſee in the following verſe: for as the Philoſopher ſaith, <hi>admiration begets Philoſophie,</hi> ſo here the worlds admiring the Beaſt,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ariſtot: lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Metap. c.</hi> 2.</note> begets Antichriſtianiſme.</p>
                     <p>At firſt men admiring the <hi>Keyes,</hi> and pretended <hi>ſeat of Peter,</hi> together with the majeſtie of ancient <hi>Rome,</hi> did eaſily attribute to the <hi>Romane biſhop primacie of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> and agreed, <hi>that every Church ſhould bring their caſes to the Church of Rome, becauſe of her power and principallity.</hi> This admiration encreaſing by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and turned into ſuperſtition, by giving unto the Pope right of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſall ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction,</hi> with divine honour, they made him to be the Antichriſt. And ſo much is ſignified by the phraſe <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>wondred after the Beaſt,</hi> that is, men being bewitched with the admiration of his power, they worſhipped him as god, and ſubjected themſelves by willing reverence under his feet, adoring all his decrees and commandements as divine oracles: for thus the Scripture uſually ſpeaks of divine worſhip: <hi>Walke after the Lord your God,</hi>

                     <p>Whence <hi>firſt,</hi> we ſee that neither the <hi>old Romane Empire,</hi> nor the <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane kingdom</hi> is properly this <hi>Beast:</hi> for they required and forced men to a civill obedience onely. And hence <hi>Alcaſars Gloſſe</hi> is frivolous and fabulous, <hi>that perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution being renewed, the nations of their own accord ſubjected themſelves unto the Beast:</hi> for no nation but by force of armes ſubjected its ſelfe unto the Romanes. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it appears that the <hi>throne which the Dragon gave to the Beaſt,</hi> is not onely a ſecular Kingdome, but alſo a ſacred Monarchie, and grounded on religion: <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it is cleare that this <hi>Beaſt</hi> is no other then the perſon whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Who oppoſeth and exalteth himſelfe above all that is called God, or that is worſhipped:</hi> that is, the Romane Antichriſt, after whom the world hath wondred theſe thouſand years: aſcribing unto him theſe verſes of triumph:
<q>
                           <l>By oracles of thine own voyce the world thou govern'ſt all,</l>
                           <l>And worthily a god on earth men think and do thee call.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And lately dedicated to: PAVLO V. VICE DEO, To <hi>Paul the fift being in Gods ſtead</hi> (<hi>which letters in Latine</hi> doe expreſly containe the <hi>number of the Beaſt</hi> 666.)

                     <p>But now who are theſe admirers? <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p n="4">4 <hi>And they worſhipped the Dragon</hi>] this declares the former: for whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaid, they <hi>wondred after the Beaſt,</hi> he now ſhews it to be the worſhipping of the <hi>Dragon,</hi> and attributing titles of divine majeſtie and power unto the <hi>Beaſt.</hi> Religious admiration (as the Scripture witneſſeth) is onely proper to God and

For by the firſt they extoll his majeſty: and by the latter the divine power of the Beaſt: In imitation of the Scripture, ſaying: <hi>To whom will ye liken God? What likeneſſe will ye make to him? Who is like to me ſaith God?</hi> As therefore the Saints and worſhippers of God cry out,

                     <p>But how are they ſaid to worſhip the <hi>Dragon?</hi> Not by profeſſion but in works.

The which will be the leſſe obſcure, becauſe in part we have heard formerly the like in chap. 11. <hi>The declaration</hi> of the <hi>power</hi> is in this verſe: <hi>The uſurpation</hi> in the two following.

                     <p>They who underſtand the former <hi>Beaſt</hi> to be the old <hi>Romane Empire,</hi> take this other to be meant of Antichriſt. But ſuch who interpret the former of Antichriſt, take this later to be his armour-bearer or gardian.</p>

                        <note place="margin">It is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured out by a double Beaſt.</note> that one and the ſame perſon have divers formes, &amp; in different reſpects be repreſented under ſundry types. For ſo Chriſt in the <hi>firſt viſion,</hi> walked amongſt the Candleſticks as a man, or the ſon of man: In the <hi>ſecond viſion</hi> he ſate on the throne, as God: The Lamb ſtood before the throne, as a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: Again, as a conquerour, he is called a <hi>Lion:</hi> An <hi>Altar,</hi> as the receiver of the bleſſed ſoules: <hi>The Angel of the Eaſt,</hi> as the ſealer of the Elect: In the <hi>third <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iſion,</hi> an Angel making perfume, as the Prieſt of the Church.</p>
                     <p>So alſo Antichriſt in the <hi>ſaid third <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iſion,</hi> is the <hi>Starre fallen from heaven,</hi> as he is an Apoſtate: <hi>The angel of the bottomleſſe pit, Abaddon, Apollyon,</hi> as he is <hi>king of the
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:96676:177"/>Locuſts:</hi> The <hi>Beaſt aſcending out of the bottomleſſe pit,</hi> as the perſecutor of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes: Again in this <hi>fourth Viſion,</hi> he is the <hi>Sea-beaſt,</hi> as a tyrant and perſecutor of the Saints: ſo alſo he is the <hi>earthly Beaſt,</hi> as an hypocrite and ſeducer of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the world, Againe in the <hi>fift <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iſion</hi> he is in the ſame reſpect <hi>a Beaſt and falſe prophet,</hi> as king and deceiver. Laſtly, in the <hi>ſixt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iſion,</hi> he is the <hi>Beaſt and Woman riding on the Beaſt,</hi> as a king and Church that beareth ſway.</p>
                     <p>The whole Revelation, I ſay, repreſents Antichriſt under divers formes, not ſimply as one perſon, but as divers, having a twofold life and original out of the <hi>ſea</hi> and <hi>earth,</hi> a double body, a twofold ſhape and perſon, <hi>viz.</hi> as being a ſecular and eccleſiaſticall perſon, a tyrant and a falſe prophet, an Emperour and high Prieſt. And indeed after this manner the Pope hath ſhewed himſelfe more then once: One while as <hi>Caeſar</hi> in his warlike armour: another while as <hi>Pope</hi> with <hi>Peters Key</hi> for his Enſigne: Of which ſee <hi>Albertus Crantzius Saxon, lib.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 26. Thus therefore <hi>Antichriſt</hi> the high Prieſt comes forth on the Theatre, firſt as a <hi>Romane Monarch:</hi> but now laying aſide his Imperiall habit, he is repreſented under the perſon of a ſeducer.</p>
                     <p>Which opinion is confirmed, becauſe this ſecond <hi>earthly Beaſt,</hi> hath no figure proper to it ſelf, onely his <hi>two hornes,</hi> and words are expreſſed, as proper to this new birth or appearing: in all other things, as it ſeemeth, being both alike: of which more afterward.</p>
                     <p>This alſo confirmeth it, that he <hi>exerciſeth all the power of the former Beaſt:</hi> now the Dragon gave not the ſame power to two, but to one Antichriſt.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, in that he makes the former Beaſt to be worſhipped, from whom if he were different, oranother in number, he would rather have taken this honour to himſelf, ſeeing he was of the ſame power and ungodlineſſe.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, what argument more evident then this, <hi>viz.</hi> that towards the end of the Chapter both the <hi>Beaſts</hi> cloſe and grow up as it were together in one, ſo that the <hi>Character, name, and number of the name</hi> is not ſaid to be of two Beaſts, but of one Beaſt onely.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly as in Chap. 17. The <hi>woman ſitting on the Beaſt</hi> in a different reſpect notes one Antichriſt with the Beaſt: ſo here the <hi>earthly Beaſt</hi> making the image of the Sea-beaſt to be worſhipped, doth repreſent with the ſaid <hi>Sea-beaſt</hi> one and the ſame Antichriſt, and that without any repugnancie.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things thus obſerved, the ſeeming contradiction in the text will eaſily be reconciled, <hi>viz.</hi> that this <hi>Beast</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>another,</hi> their originail and riſe to be different, and that one acteth in the ſight of the other, &amp;c. But theſe and the like things do onely ſerve to denote under divers types the different nature, diſpoſition and actions of one and the ſame Antichriſt, as by the interpretation it will appear: unto which now we come.</p>

Hitherto we read not that the <hi>Dragon</hi> ſpake, but gave his throne to the <hi>former beast:</hi> as alſo his mouth, by which the ſame is governed verſ. 5. the which the Beaſt opening, <hi>spake great things and blaspemies,</hi> verſ 6.

                     <p>Now the ſpeech of the Beaſt is nothing elſe, but the doctrine he preacheth as if it were the Lambs: but in truth it is the Dragons.

                        <hi>Ribera</hi> feineth that it is the forme of the Dragon, which Antichriſt ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to be worſhipped: <hi>But</hi> becauſe he ſees there is no waight in the fiction, therefore he will have it a future Character, or ſome marke, which ſecretly ſhall ſhew that name in which he moſt glorieth, that is, the name of Chriſt or the Meſſias, by which he ſhall deceive the Iews, many Chriſtians and Sarazens alſo, to wit ☧ or Χ—Ρ wherby <hi>Conſtantine</hi> in his Enſigne did in ſhort include the name of Chriſt, in token that he was deliverour of the world, expellour of tyrants, and ſettler of publike peace, ſuch as Antichriſt would alſo ſeem to be.</p>

                        <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> being aſhamed of theſe triffles, ſaith <hi>that it cannot be known what this Character is, till Antichriſt ſhall come:</hi> in the <hi>interim</hi> he pleaſantly derides our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, as being ignorant of this Character, which he willingly refuſeth to know, leſt he bewray the Pope: <hi>But</hi> undoubtedly <hi>the marke of the Beaſt,</hi> ſhould not ſo often have been uſed in this propheſie, if it were altogether hid, for then it ſhould be no Character. Neither doth it follow, that our Interpreters know not what it is, although ſome ſeem to underſtand thereby the unction of their holy Chriſme; Others the profeſſion of the Romiſh faith: Others their oath of fidelity to the Pope. For all comes but to one thing, as noting an obligation or bondage to Antichriſt.</p>
                     <p>But put caſe we were ignorant of the Character, will it therefore follow that the Pope is not Antichriſt, in whom all other <hi>Markes</hi> of him, doe evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre together.</p>

                     <p>This Pope <hi>Martin V.</hi> hath moſt clearly expreſſed in his <hi>Bull</hi> annexed to the <hi>Councill of Conſtance: where he enjoyneth by an oath all ſuch as profeſſe themſelves ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to the Romane Sea, whither Emperours, Kings, Princes, Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earles, Barons, Souldiours, Protestants, Rectors, Counſellours, Preſidents, Communities and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities of Kingdoms, Provinces, Cities, Towns, Caſtles, Villages and ſuch like territories and places, as alſo all other who exerciſe temporall juriſdiction: alſo all Clergie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and inquiſitours, that they expell all ſuch as hold not the faith and communion of the Romane Church, as being ſcabbed ſheep, infecting the flocke of the Lord: nor permitting them to preach, nor to dwell in their dominions, neither to make contracts, bargaine or trade with them, or ſuffer them to enjoy with Chriſtians the comforts of an humane life.</hi> Now is not this the very thing here teſtified by the ſpirit, that the <hi>Beaſt</hi> ſhould do, <hi>viz.</hi> that all of what eſtate ſoever, as <hi>receive not his Character might not buy nor ſell.</hi> Thus we have <hi>Pope Martin</hi> himſelf to be the beſt interpreter, and indeed a full practiſer of this propheſie, who as a <hi>Rat</hi> by his own marke declares himſelf to the world to be that <hi>Antichriſtian Beast.</hi>

                        <hi>ſix hundred ſixty ſix.</hi> Hence ſome thinke that <hi>John</hi> expreſſeth not the numerall name of Antichriſt, but the number of yeares after which he ſhould be revealed: <hi>viz.</hi> after 666. <hi>years:</hi> of this opinion is <hi>Balaeus: Bullinger</hi> and others: But many things ſeem to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the beginning of the years would not accord, for if we reckon from the time of Chriſts birth, there will be, not 666. <hi>years,</hi> but onely 606. till Antichriſt did riſe: if from the time of the Viſion (as it ſeems it muſt be done) then there will be onely 510. years: If with <hi>Balaus</hi> ſixty years before Chriſt, or at the <hi>Conſulſhip of Cicero</hi> when <hi>Judea</hi> was reduced by <hi>Pompie</hi> into a Province under the Romane Empire, there can no ſufficient reaſon be alleaged for ſuch an anticipation.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, by this means the wiſdom which <hi>John</hi> hence promiſeth could not be attained by <hi>the number of the Beaſt:</hi> for he teacheth that by the <hi>number</hi> the <hi>name,</hi> by the <hi>name</hi> the <hi>Character,</hi> &amp; ſo the reſt might be ſearched into: which indeed may be gathered from the numerall letters, but not by the words themſelves of the number.</p>
                     <p>Adde to this, that verſ. 17. and Chap. 15. verſ. 2. <hi>John</hi> calls it expreſly the <hi>number of the name of the Beast,</hi> but not the number of the Beaſts riſing. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not a number of time but name.</p>
                     <p>This makes me rather aſſent to them who judge that by this <hi>number</hi> Antichriſts name is opened,

Touching the truth indeed I am ſilent: for what place is it where all things are ſo full of lies: The aire, earth, houſes, townes, ſireets, court-yards, porches, halls, beds, roofes of houſes, clefts of walls, the ſecret and cloſe roomes of houſes and temples, the ſeats of Judges and Popes, yea in the laſt place the very mouthes of men, their becks, geſtures, voices and countenance.</hi>

<pb n="320" facs="tcp:96676:185"/>for Satan, &amp;c.

But for brevity ſake I refer the Chriſtian reader unto the <hi>Catalogue of witneſſes of the truth:</hi> where it is moſt clearly proved, by innumerable witneſſes of Chriſt,

                     <p>Now let us conſider the <hi>wiſdome</hi> that is in the <hi>number of the Beaſt:</hi> of which <hi>John</hi> cryes out: <hi>Here is wiſdome.</hi> From the number laid down 666. he cloſely bids us to ſearch our al the other myſteries: for here we have the name of the Beaſt <hi>Latinos, Romanus.</hi> This name both the Greek and Hebrew number doth declare. <hi>By the name</hi> alſo we have the <hi>Character:</hi> for all that will <hi>buy and ſell</hi> muſt profeſſe the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine ſervice,</hi> or <hi>Romane faith,</hi> and be ſworn vaſſals of the Romiſh Church. By the ſaid name and Character is manifeſted the <hi>Image of the Beaſt</hi> that all were to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>mad worſhip</hi> of ſtocks and ſtones, by which every one is conſtrained at the ſound of the Cornet, Flute, Harpe, Sackbut, Pſaltery, Organ, Dulcimer, and al kinds of Muſick to adore the image or idol that is neareſt to him. Laſtly, by the <hi>name, Character</hi> and <hi>image</hi> of the Beaſt appeareth what was both the <hi>land</hi> and <hi>Sea-Beaſt</hi> exerciſing the ſame power, and eccaſioning all the evils which hitherto have been ſpoken of.</p>
                     <p>But what is the reaſon,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Why the holy Ghost doth not expreſſe the Pope of Rome. See the notes on verſ.</hi> 1.</note> that the ſpirit doth not more clearely expreſſe this name?

Now it pleaſed the ſpirit thus to manifeſt theſe myſteries even by darke expreſſions, that the faithfull hereby might be ſtirred up to diligent ſearching after them, and leſt that hence diſturbances ſhould be occaſioned before the time, and the Church endangered. The Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. might have ſaid more openly, <hi>that the ſon of perdition ſhould ſit in the Church of Rome:</hi> and that <gap reason="foreign">

Certainly either the Popes themſelves would have laboured long ago to take away this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation out of the ſight and memory of men, that they might not be bewrayed. Or elſe the myſtery of iniquity which was a growing, ſhould never have broken forth, becauſe the <hi>Romane Emperours</hi> would ſoon have caſt down the Popes out of their ſeat, leſt they ſhould be forced to kiſſe their feet, and try by experience their great tyranny: Now thus the counſell of God (a thing impoſſible to be done) ſhould have been hindred, and this propheſie never fulfilled.</p>

                     <p>Beſides what may be the meaning alſo of his Enſigne, <hi>a Dragon flying under an Eagle,</hi> I leave to them that can underſtand it: about which if you pleaſe read <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſar vestigat. pag.</hi> 372. for it belongs not to me to declare ſuch great myſteries. Now to returne to the matter. Although <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſhould feine ſix hundred ſuch like numerall names, yet it will no way weaken the force of our argument. For we doe not goe about to prove who is Antichriſt, by the numerall name one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but by the <hi>name</hi> joyned with other <hi>markes of the Beast.</hi> For example: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it would be no ſound reaſoning thus to reaſon: he that is borne at <hi>Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem</hi> is the Meſſias: <hi>But</hi> the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> is borne at <hi>Bethlehem. Ergo</hi> he is the Meſſias. Yet thus it doth moſt firmly follow. He that is borne at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:96676:187"/>hath all other propheticall notes of the Meſſias, he is the Meſſias: But the Son of <hi>Marie</hi> hath them all: Therefore he is the Meſſias. So touching Antichriſt it will not altogether firmely follow by the numerall name alone: but yet it follows moſt firmely from the numeral name joyned with the reſt of the notes of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> all concurring in the <hi>Pope of Rome,</hi> as hitherto hath been ſhewed.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Latine,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Papa Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus vel Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet nomen numerale beſtiae.</note> or <hi>Romane Pope</hi> hath the numerall name of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> he hath alſo the other Apoſtolicall markes of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> or <hi>Antichrist.</hi> Therefore he is the Antichriſt.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. He ſaith, that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> profeſſeth himſelfe ignorant of <hi>Antichriſts name,</hi> and that this the trueſt opinion.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer: he falſyfies <hi>Irenaeus</hi> words. For he ſaith not that Antichriſts name cannot be known: But becauſe there are many names of this number, therefore he ſaith, <hi>it is more certaine and without danger to ſtay till the propheſie be fulfilled, then to ſuspect and geſſe at ſeverall names.</hi> Now this makes for us againſt <hi>Bellarmin:</hi> for <hi>Irenaeus</hi> giues us to underſtand, that the propheſie being fulfilled, we may more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely and ſafely judge of the name. But long agoe the fulfilling of this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie began to be accompliſhed in <hi>the Pope of Rome,</hi> as the comparing of hiſtories and times with this propheſie doth evidently manifeſt: The which if <hi>Irenaeus</hi> had ſeen, he would undoubtedly have concluded with us that <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>Lateinos</hi> was not onely probably, but of a certainty <hi>the name of the Beaſt. Bellarmin</hi> therefore doth here deceitfully require ignorance, feining that both he and the generality of men are ignorant of <hi>Antichriſts name:</hi> &amp; hence concludeth that he is not yet come: thereby to turne away the eyes of the ſimple from the <hi>Romiſh Antichriſt:</hi> As if forſooth, that which he will not know, or the rude multitude is ignorant of: cannot therefore, neither be, nor be known of others. If ſo, then <hi>Irenaeus</hi> indeed had added in vaine: viz. <hi>that John ſheweth this number of the name, that we might avoide him when he commeth, knowing who he is.</hi> Therefore by the number of the name it may be known who he is, and ſo conſequently the name it ſelf alſo.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. At laſt (to draw a vaile over his pretended ignorance) he ſaith, that after Antichriſt is come, his name ſhall be moſt manifeſtly known, like as the name of Chriſt <hi>(Ieſus)</hi> after Chriſt was come, began to be openly knowne unto all, where as before it was unknown unto the Iewes, although the Prophets had foretold many things of him: as alſo a certain <hi>Sybill</hi> in verſes had declared the number of his name to be 888. Hence he infers, ſeeing the greateſt controverſie that is,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>See Abbot demonſt. ca.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 34. <hi>ſect</hi> 17.</note> is touching Antichriſts name: therefore Antichriſt is not as yet come: and ſo conſequently the Pope is not Antichriſt. This he calleth an <hi>inſoluble</hi> argument, but there is no waight at all in it: for the things he feineth are all falſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. <hi>It is falſe</hi> that Antichriſt being come his name ſhall then be clearely known by all: for <hi>his comming ſhall be with all deceiveableneſſe of unrighteouſneſſe,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2. Therefore he ſhall not come openly, but by a feined and fraudulent name he ſhall deceive the world, ſo that it ſhall be a very hard thing to know him: for he will <hi>transforme himſelfe into an Angel of light,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

Therefore his name ſhall not be openly known unto all men: but as the Devill came to ſow tares in the Lords field not openly, but when men were aſleep: ſo Antichriſt ſhall creep in while the world is not aware there of.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. <hi>It is falſe,</hi> that the Prophets foretold any thing of the name <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>: And to thinke that God ſhould foretell that by the idolatrous <hi>Sybills,</hi> the which he ſpake not of by his own Prophets, let him beleeve that liſteth.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. It is alſo falſe, that after Chriſt was come, his name was moſt certainely known to all: for <hi>Iohn</hi> expreſly ſpeaketh of the Iewes living in the time of his comming:
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1, 10.</note> that <hi>the world knew him not: And that he came unto his owne, and his own received him not.</hi> However therefore they were not ignorant of the name <hi>Ieſus,</hi> yet they knew that it was common to many other men: but they did not know nor beleeve, that it was the name of Chriſt the Meſſias: therefore the name <hi>Ieſus</hi>
                        <pb n="325" facs="tcp:96676:187"/>who ſhould be the Chriſt, was not known unto the Iewes.</p>
                     <p>To this day alſo the name <hi>Ieſus,</hi> who is the Chriſt, is no way known unto the <hi>Iewes, Turkes</hi> and <hi>Pagans:</hi> for however they know indeed the name <hi>Ieſus,</hi> yet they neither know nor beleeve, that it is the name of Chriſt the Meſſias: By the like reaſon we may conclude, that although Antichriſt is come, yet to the Papiſts and many others <hi>Antichriſts name</hi> is not certainely known: for the Papiſts take not their Pope to be Antichriſt, for although they well know the number of the name <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> and <hi>Romanus:</hi> yet they neither know, nor beleeve, that it is the name of Antichriſt. But as the ignorance and obſtinate deniall of the Iewes could not hinder the name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> to be the true name of Chriſt: ſo the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and obſtinate deniall of the Papiſts lets not, but that the name <hi>Lateinos</hi> and <hi>Romanus,</hi> is truely the name of Antichriſt.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. <hi>That is alſo falſe</hi> which he affirmeth touching the great controverſie about Antichriſts name. For howſoever the Papiſts raiſe a controverſie about it: yet to us (who know Antichriſt as being revealed by the Spirit of Chriſts mouth to ſit in the <hi>Latine Church</hi>) his name is no way controvertible; for there is none of us, but eaſily aſſents to the opinion of <hi>Jrenaeus,</hi> that his name is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> or Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MANUS, which are names of the ſame number, demonſtrating the <hi>Pope of Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">V. The concluſion of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is falſe, that <hi>if Antichriſt were come, there ſhould be no queſtion about his name.</hi> For this is ſufficiently apparent to all who doe not purpoſely ſhut their eyes againſt the light of the Sun: And hence the <hi>inſoluble ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the Papiſts</hi> is turned upon themſelves, for as much as the number of the name of Antichriſt is generally known, ſo as all do point as with the finger, at the <hi>Latine Pope:</hi> It being certaine that Antichriſt is now come, and that he is the chiefe Prieſt at Rome.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. And laſtly, that is falſe which he gathereth out of <hi>Marlorate</hi> touching the obſcurity of this place: <hi>viz.</hi> that this oracle being moſt obſcure and aenigmaticall, is not as yet fulfilled, <hi>for all propheſies,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>when they are fulfilled are moſt cleare.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But <hi>O Bellarmine,</hi> are not the propheſies touching Chriſts comming in the fleſh fulfilled? and are they now moſt cleare unto the Iewes? nay they remaine moſt obſcure and aenigmaticall unto them even after their full accompliſhment, <hi>becauſe their mindes were blinded, and the vaile of Moſes remaines upon their heart even unto this day:</hi> not to ſpeak of us Chriſtians: unto whom many viſions of this <hi>Revelation,</hi> undoubtedly fulfilled, doe nevertheleſſe remaine obſcure in regard of our negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: like as many oracles touching the abolition of the ceremoniall and <hi>judicial Law of Moſes,</hi> about the difference of meats and peoples which were taken away and fulfilled in Chriſt, remained obſcure and controvertible even to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles themſelves, as the Acts &amp; Epiſtles of the Apoſtles witnes. Propheſies therfore become moſt cleare by the fulfilling of them, to wit, not to them who maliciouſly ſhut their eyes, or open them not to receive the light: but to them alone who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently attend unto the accompliſhment of them. This is the cauſe that this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie touching <hi>Antichrist,</hi> after the fulfilling thereof in ſome meaſure (for yet it is not fully accompliſhed) remains moſt obſcure unto the Papiſts: who ſeeing wil not ſee, although an egge is not more like to an egge, then the Pope of Rome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Beaſt.</p>

                        <hi>Stood on Mount Sion</hi>] that is,
<note place="margin">Why he standeth on a mount.</note> in the Church, which ſtandeth firmly as <hi>Mount Sion</hi> againſt all the devices of the <hi>Dragon</hi> and the <hi>Beaſt.</hi> Wherefore ſits he not, but ſtandeth? <hi>Same</hi> ſay, becauſe he was ſlaine and roſe againe: <hi>Others,</hi> becauſe he is the judge and avenger of the Church. But he comes forth afterward as the Iudge ſitting on the cloud, verſ. 14. Here therefore he ſtands as a watchman on the tower watching for the Churches ſafety, as Iſay 21.8. <hi>And he cryed, A Lyon: My Lord I ſtand continually upon the watch tower in the day time;
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.1.</note> And I am ſet in my ward whole rights, &amp;c. I will stand upon my watch.</hi> Neither ſtandeth he alone, but with 144000 <hi>ſealed in their for theads.</hi> Now let us conſider wherefore the <hi>Lambe</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth here ſtanding on the Mount, with ſo many <hi>ſealed ones:</hi> And to what times this propheſie belongs: and who theſe ſealed are.</p>
                     <p>Touching the ſcope I finde interpreters to agree. <hi>viz.</hi> that the Lamb is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> Chriſt the preſerver, to Antichriſt the deſtroyer. And now <hi>Ribera</hi> acknowledgeth that this ſerves for the comfort of the righteous,
<note place="margin">The ſcope of the Lambs appearing on the mount.</note> to cauſe us aſſuredly to beleeve that during the rage of the Divell and Antichriſt againſt the Saints (before ſpoken of in Chapter 13.) Chriſt is not aſleep, nor neglects his Church, but ſtands on the watch for her ſafety, leſt the wheat ſhould be corrupted, although indeed the chaſſe or wicked by Gods permiſſion follow and adore the Beaſt, and run into deſtruction. But when and how this ſhould be, ſeemes unto him moſt difficult to be expounded: neither hath he any thing to ſay, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the vulgar errour, he refers the following things unto the foure yeeres reigne of his Antichriſt.</p>
                     <p>Our interpreters alſo ſtill keepe to the poſition: that howſoever Antichriſt ſhal ſway farre and neare, yet Chriſt alwaies will have his elect and ſealed, which ſhall ſtand with him on the <hi>Mount,</hi> where their ſalvation ſhall remaine ſafe and unmoved: which indeed is moſt truely ſpoken: but this thing is generally trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of through the whole Revelation: And the queſtion ſtill remaineth touching the order of the viſion, and the time when Chriſt chiefly ſtood with his <hi>ſealed Ones.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſay therefore,
<note place="margin">When the Lamb ſtood with his ſealed ones.</note> when the Beaſt aſcended out of the Sea, &amp; out of the earth then alſo the <hi>Lamb</hi> appeared on the mount with <hi>them that were ſealed:</hi> When Antichriſt (I ſay) had invaded the Church, brought the ſame under him and ſeduced the
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:96676:189"/>world. Then the <hi>Lamb</hi> in appearance had loſt his poſſeſſion. Then the <hi>woman flying into the wilderneſſe</hi> vaniſhed out of the ſight of men, ſo as ſhe appeared no where, as if there had been none. This hapned, when a little after <hi>Gregory,</hi> the Romane Pope ſate on the Chaire of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſall peſtilence,</hi> as before we have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Then the <hi>Church fled into the wilderneſſe,</hi> not by change of place (for it remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Romane Empire) but by loſſe of her ornaments and change of ſhape. Becauſe even from that time it reteined indeed the name of the Church (for Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt was to ſit in the temple of God) but in very deed it began to be changed in to a worldly kingdome of Antichriſt. And that gaſhly forme of the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the Weſt, which we now ſee, but the Church gathered by the Apoſtles being thruſt into the wilderneſſe, did no where appeare, all publick congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations either at <hi>Rome</hi> or other places being polluted with idolatry, untill God taking compaſſion on the ſeed of the woman in the wilderneſſe, vouchſafed againe to meaſure the temple, and purge the Church in the age of our forefathers.</p>
                     <p>Now the godly may thinke, and ſo much indeed the Sophiſters doe object,
<note place="margin">Whether there were no Church under An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt.</note> did the Church therefore then utterly ceaſe to be? Was there no Church before <hi>Huſſe</hi> or <hi>Luther?</hi> Was Chriſt either negligent, or unable to defend his ſpouſe? Is it not written. <hi>The gates of hell ſhall not prevaile againſt her?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But behold the Lambe ſtanding here on mount Sion with the Elect and ſealed; ſo that Chriſt was no way wanting to his Church: he ſuffered indeed by a ſecret and juſt judgement, that Antichriſt ſhould take in his poſſeſſion, and to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward view make ſpoile (as it were) of all things, notwithſtanding in the midſt of Antichriſtian corruption, he alwaies ſtood as a carefull watchman preſerving to himſelfe 144000. <hi>that were ſealed,</hi> who worſhipped not the <hi>Beaſt nor his Image,</hi> and theſe were his Church and Spouſe, like as in the corrupteſt time of Iſrael, when no true worſhippers, ſave onely <hi>Elias,</hi> ſeemed to remaine, God reſerved to himſelfe 7000. <hi>who had not bowed the knee to Baal.</hi> But thou wilt ſay, wherefore did he permit Antichriſt thus to invade the Church? I anſwer, ſhe juſtly deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſuch a triall, chaſtiſement and diſſolution. See <hi>Cyprian de lapſis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This ſtanding of the Lan be therefore belongs to all the time (even a thouſand yeares and more) which hath been ſince Antichriſts riſing, untill the reformation of the Church: begun by <hi>Wickleffe</hi> in <hi>England, John Huſſe</hi> in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and in the ages after them, by <hi>Luther, Zwinglius, Melanchion,</hi> and their fellow bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in <hi>Germany,</hi> being all great oppoſers of Popery.</p>
                     <p>But theſe <hi>ſealed</hi> did then no where appeare, they had no publick meetings: for al Churches together worſhipped the Beaſt. What then? becauſe they appeared not to man, were they therefore hidden to God? The 7000. <hi>in Iſrael</hi> had no uncorrupted congregation: but were mingled (in outward appearance) with the idolatrous Balaamites. The ſame thing is to be thought of theſe here, ſometimes they lay hid in the Popiſh Church, and ſometimes openly made warre with the Beaſt by the ſword of the Spirit. For thoſe Saints againſt whom the Beaſt made warre and overcame, Chap. 13.7. who were they? not whole Churches (for ſuch were all ſubject to the <hi>Beaſt</hi>) but ſuch teachers, confeſſours and martyrs as oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the idolatry of the Papiſts: of whom the hiſtories of their time make menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thus it appeareth to what times this propheſie appertaineth.</p>
                     <p>Now it remaines to ſpeake of the <hi>ſealed</hi> who they were:
<note place="margin">Who theſe ſealed are.</note> The Papiſts doe much weary themſelves about it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lyras</hi> fancy I paſſe by, who tells us of 144000. <hi>Monkes</hi> profeſſing virginity,

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ribera</hi> alleadgeth <hi>Hieroms</hi> opnion, that they were the 144000.

                        <hi>ſealed</hi> out of the twelve tribes of Iſrael, which ſhould be converted unto Chriſt in the laſt foure years reigne of Antichriſt. Of which Chap. 7. But he proves nothing. For <hi>firſt,</hi> it is not likely that the Iewes then to be converted ſhould all be Virgines: ſeeing
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:96676:190"/>the Hebrews did never highly prize ſuch a ſtate of life. II. Hence it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that no married perſon ſhould be converted. III. The Virgines of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſhould be excluded. But as the opinion touching the Iewes to be converted is falſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> (as Chap. 7. we have ſhewed) ſo his reaſons are frivolous, grounded on a falſe ſuppoſition of virgines, of which more by and by.</p>
                     <p>He therefore alledgeth the opinion of <hi>Arethas</hi> as more probable, that the 144000. <hi>ſealed,</hi> ſpoken of in ch. 7. are not here to be underſtood: and that becauſe the article is omitted, for here it is not ſaid <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, intimating that theſe were others, namely ſuch of the Gentiles as ſhould be converted. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth this pleaſe him, becauſe it is not likely that there ſhould ſo few thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands be converted out of ſo many nations, and in ſo many ages. And indeed he juſtly rejects it. For the reaſon taken from the omiſſion of the article is of no waight, his argument alſo proves nothing: becauſe a great and difinite number is put for an indefinite, as <hi>Beda</hi> hath rightly obſerved.</p>
                     <p>At laſt he affirmeth, that they are 144000. <hi>virgines</hi> to be converted to Chriſt both of the Iewes and Gentiles under Antichriſt. But he is deceived. I. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time of Antichriſt, which is now, and hath been theſe many yeares, and is not (as he ſuppoſeth) yet to come, namely in the laſt foure yeares of the world. II. Alſo in the Epithite of Virgines, the which (as afterward I will ſhew) is not corporally but ſpiritually to be underſtood.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alcaſar</hi> makes theſe <hi>ſealed,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Alcaſars o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.</note> to be the faithful of the Primitive Church under the Romane Emperours. <hi>But</hi> he erreth: for theſe as conquerours ſtood with the Lamb even while Antichriſt reigned.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> therefore we are to hold, that theſe 144000. <hi>ſealed,</hi> are the ſame ſpoken of Chap. 7. becauſe this part of the Chapter doth altogether anſwer to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Chapter, in which as we ſaid, is conteined an antitheſis of the <hi>third Act</hi> of the <hi>ſecond <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iſion.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> that this multitude of <hi>ſealed ones,</hi> are no other, then the <hi>remnant of the womans ſeed,</hi> with whom (after her flight into the wildernes) the <hi>Dragon,</hi> made war Cha. 12.17. as appeareth by the deſcription there added, and repeated in the 12. verſe of this Chapter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thridly,</hi> that they are no other then thoſe Saints, to whom it was given to make warre with the Beaſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.7.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Laſtly,</hi> that they are the faithful, whether teachers or hearers of: the godly, I ſay, who from Antichriſts riſing until the reformation withſtood the tyranny of Popes, and retained the purity of the Goſpel, to wit, al the martyrs, and profeſſours, touching whom, ſee the <hi>Bookes of Martyrs,</hi> and <hi>the Catalogue of the witneſſes of the truth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They are ſaid <hi>to be ſealed in the name of his Father</hi>] To wit, of the Lambes: <hi>The Kings Bible</hi> reads it, <hi>in the name of the Lamb and of his Father:</hi> What is this, but to ſhew that they conſtantly profeſſed the doctrine of the Father, and faith of the Lamb againſt Antichriſt, by an alluſion unto the Character of the Beaſt. For as the Beaſt imprints a Character in the right hand or forehead of his worſhippers, Chap. 13.16. which is an obligation to Antichriſt. So the Lamb imprints a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter in the foreheads of his worſhippers. <hi>The name of the father and of the Lamb,</hi> which is a profeſſion of the true Chriſtian religion, and open deniall and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from Antichriſts idolatry and abominations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And I heard a voice from heaven</hi>] We have heard who the multitude of the ſealed are. Their titles ſhould now be ſpoken of in the next place: but the joyfull ſhout of the inhabitants in heaven is put in between, becauſe of the preſervation of ſo many <hi>ſealed ones</hi> from the idolatry and tyranny of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and then their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent commendations are afterward rehearſed.</p>
                     <p>The connexion and ſence ſeemes to be obſcure unto interpreters. But I doe expound this part of the <hi>third Viſion,</hi> by that part of the <hi>ſecond Viſion,</hi> in Chap. 7. touching the 144000. <hi>that were ſealed,</hi> ſeeing all things excellently accord.
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:96676:190"/>There <hi>John</hi> ſaw the 144000. <hi>ſealed in their foreheads:</hi> here, the ſame multitude ſtanding with the <hi>Lamb.</hi> There he heareth an innumerable multitude <hi>clothed in white robes, ſinging to God and the Lamb before the throne.</hi> Here he heareth <hi>a voice as it were of many waters, a voyce,</hi> I ſay, <hi>of harpers finging a new ſong.</hi> There enquiring who they were <hi>arayed in white robes:</hi> it is anſwered: <hi>Theſe are they which came out of great tribulation,</hi> &amp;c. Here not enquiring, he heareth from the company of the heavenly inhabitants: <hi>Theſe are they, who are not polluted with women,</hi> &amp;c.
<note place="margin">The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets it ſelfe.</note> All things being thus alike containe the ſame hiſtory. Thus we ſee that the whole Scripture, eſpecially the <hi>Revelation</hi> interprets it ſelfe. But I will more clearely touch every particular.</p>
                     <p>There are three parts of the compariſon. Firſt, there <hi>John</hi> ſaw 12000. ſervants of the living God ſealed in their foreheads by an Angell,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>The compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the ſealed here with theſe in Chap.</hi> 7.</note> out of every of the tribes of Iſrael: making together 144000. Here he ſeeth the ſame multitude of the <hi>ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ones</hi> ſtanding with the Lambe on Mount Sion: <hi>The name of the Lamb, and the name of his Father being written on their foreheads.</hi> Thus he expoundeth, what was that <hi>Seale of the living God.</hi> In both places the multitude of the ſealed ſignifies the combate of faithfull Martyrs and Profeſſours whom the Lamb had reſerved with himſelfe theſe thouſand yeeres on <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> that is, in the Church groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under Antichriſt, even from the time of the <hi>Womans flight into the wilderneſſe,</hi> until the new meaſuring of the Temple, that is, from the riſing of Antichriſt unto the reformation of the Church and doctrine, accompliſhed in the age of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond member of the compariſon here followeth. There <hi>John ſaw a great and innumerable multitude before the throne, clothed in white robes, in the ſight of the Lamb, and of all the Angels, the foure and twenty Elders; and of the foure Beaſts: and ſinging with a great voice ſalvation to God and the Lamb,</hi> &amp;c. The which multitude we ſhewed to be the triumphant Church ſucceeding the Apoſtolicall times, who having finiſhed their warfare, did now reſt in heaven, continually prayſing God and the Lamb: Here he heareth <hi>a voice from heaven as of many waters</hi>] This is the voice of that innumerable multitude out of all nations and kindreds and tongues mentioned Chap. 7.9. for <hi>many waters</hi> (as the Angell interprets it, Chap. 17.15.) <hi>are many peoples, multitudes, nations and tongues.</hi> This voice by and by he calleth <hi>a new ſong.</hi> In the beginning indeed he heard as it were a confuſed ſound of a multitude: but by little and little he more narrowly obſerved what, and whoſe voice it was: Even as the ſinging of Muſicians afarre off ſeemes to be confuſed: but by approaching nearer and nearer the gravity of their accord, and ſweetneſſe of their harmony is more diſtinctly perceived.</p>
                     <p>Preſently, therefore he alſo heard <hi>as it were the ſound of a great thunder</hi>] which ſome apply to the terribleneſſe thereof. But this little agrees with the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Epithite, and is repugnant to the ſcope of the harmony. I therefore expound it of the vehemency of the voice: <hi>viz.</hi> that now theſe ſingers did not lightly ſtrike or paſſe thorow the eares of <hi>John:</hi> but they thundred it out with all their might, which undoubtedly denotes the vehement joy of the Saints in heaven.</p>
                     <p>At laſt he heard <hi>the voice of harpers</hi>] He ſaith not, <hi>as it were of harpers,</hi> as before, <hi>as it were of many waters, as it were of thunder, &amp;c.</hi> intimating that now he did plainely heare and perceive the harmonious accord of harpers playing on their harpes, as being moſt delightfull, artificious and ſweet, ſuch as is the muſick of moſt skilfull harpers. In Chap. 5.8. <hi>The foure Beasts and foure and twenty Elders</hi> were brought in as <hi>Harpers</hi> before the throne: but theſe <hi>Harpers</hi> here are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced from the <hi>Beaſts</hi> and <hi>Elders,</hi> for they are ſaid <hi>to ſing before them,</hi> verſ. 3. This therefore is a diſtinct troop of bleſſed Martyrs and Profeſſours of the Church triumphant, who as I ſaid even now, were departed this life,
<note place="margin">The allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Law and the Goſpel is not here ſet forth.</note> &amp; had finiſhed their warfare before Antichriſts riſing.</p>
                     <p>I am not ignorant that moſt interpreters allegorically apply <hi>this voice,</hi> firſt thundring, &amp; afterward pleaſant: the firſt to the preaching of the <hi>Law,</hi> which is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:96676:191"/>to the wicked: the ſecond of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> which ſweetly affects the conſciences of the godly: but this application here ſeems to me to be ſtrange and uncouth, for after the appearance of the dreadfull monſters, <hi>viz. the Dragon, Beaſts,</hi> &amp;c. Now comes, this <hi>company of harpers</hi>

                        <hi>who alſo ſung.</hi> He expoundeth what the melodious accord of the harpers was, and where.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As it were a new ſong</hi>] New harmonies uſually more delight the hearers then ſuch as are old, and often heard. Such was the <hi>Song of theſe Harpers,</hi> rare, new, and worthy to be heard. Or <hi>New,</hi> that is, excellently ſetting forth the new, rare and unſpeakeable benefits of God and the Lamb: for ſo the Hebrewes (as generally may be ſeene in <hi>Davids Pſalmes</hi>) call that <hi>a new ſong,</hi> which is rare and moſt ſweet.</p>
                     <p>The Argument of this new ſong, <hi>John</hi> here indeed doth not ſpeak of: but he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it before in Chap. 5.9. Where the <hi>Beaſts</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> ſung a new ſong to the Lambe ſaying: <hi>Thou art worthy to take the booke, and to open the ſeales thereof: for thou waſt ſlaine and haſt redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation, &amp;c.</hi> And Chap. 7.9.10. Where the innumerable multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude clothed in white robes cried with a great voice: <hi>Salvation be to God who ſitteth on the throne, and unto the Lamb:</hi> And a little after: <hi>Amen, bleſſing and glory, and wiſdome, and thankeſgiving, and honour and power, and might be unto our God for ever and ever, Amen,</hi> &amp;c. Vndoubtedly this ſong was the ſame.</p>
                     <p>As for the circumſtance of the place, It was <hi>before the throne and before the foure Beaſts and Elders</hi>] Hereby he intimates two things: <hi>firſt,</hi> that this <hi>voice</hi> was in heaven, and ſo we are to thinke that <hi>John</hi> heard the ſame from thence. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was a ſong of the Church triumphant in heaven, not of the militant in earth. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that this multitude of ſingers is diſtinct from the Beaſt and Elders: for they are ſaid <hi>to ſing before them.</hi> They were therefore a certaine troope of trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Saints who afterward came to the company of Beaſts and Elders, for the Church triumphant is not yet full, but daily increaſeth with new members, who finiſhing their warfare here on earth, are added unto them, untill in the end it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come truely univerſall and catholick. Touching the Beaſts and Elders, ſee the notes on Chap. 5. verſ. 4.6.7. and Chap. 7. verſ. 9.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And no man could learne that ſong</hi>] Now he turnes his ſpeech to the multitude that were <hi>ſealed,</hi> honouring them with excellent titles, which are <hi>ſeven</hi> in number, as we obſerved in the <hi>analyſis:</hi> of which ſome were proper unto the ſtate of their warfare in this life. But the moſt appertaine unto the ſtate of Glory. For the drift of this place is to teach us, that Chriſt will not onely preſerve his elect or ſealed in their conflict againſt Antichriſt: but alſo at length gather them unto the heavenly multitude of Harpers, that with like joy they may ſing <hi>a new ſong to God and the Lamb.</hi> This chiefly ſerves to comfort the godly here groaning under the croſſe.</p>
                     <p>Now this is the third member of the compariſon, for as Chap. 7.13. One of the Elders asking <hi>John, Who are theſe?</hi> did declare the like titles of them that were clothed in robes: <hi>Theſe are they which came out of great tribulation, and have waſhed their robes, &amp;c.</hi> So here <hi>John</hi> doth either himſelfe, or heareth this multitude of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ones to be adorned with like honourable prayſes (for perhaps theſe were the words of the harpers touching them that were ſealed) <hi>Theſe are they which are not defiled with women,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe epithites ſeeme to be diverſe: but moſt are of the ſame nature, or are conſequents, as we may ſee by the diligent comparing of them together.</p>
                     <p>The firſt title in which they differ from others, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is their teachableneſſe, <hi>that no man could learne the new ſong but they</hi>] Here <hi>firſt</hi> it appeareth,
<note place="margin">Teachable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſo.</note> wherefore this <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:96676:191"/>of Harpers in heaven</hi> were here brought forth, to wit, as examples of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led yet remaining on earth: for our indeavour &amp; ſtudie ought to be the ſame with theirs in heaven. By which very thing the moſt ſweet communion of the Saints, both in heaven and in earth is ſignified.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> the docility and praerogative of them that were ſealed, is commended: They, and they onely could learne this new ſong. But how can they doe it? not indeed by their own wiſdome, but by the ſpeciall illumination of the Spirit, which God onely vouchſafeth unto them, &amp; therefore the reprobate cannot learne it. But doe not many of them know the doctrine of the Goſpel? True, yet have they not a ſaving knowledge. They doe ſometimes profeſſe and boaſt of faith, &amp;c. but they never can apply the benefits of the Lamb by faith unto themſelves, and praiſe him with their whole heart. For <hi>no man can ſay that Jeſus is the Lord,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3.</note> but by the holy Ghost.</hi> This teachableneſſe therefore is a priviledge of the ſealed.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, hence it appeareth, what this <hi>ſeale</hi> of the living God is, which the faithfull are ſaid to have in <hi>their foreheads,</hi> Chap. 7.3. In verſ. 1. it is called <hi>the name of the Lamb, and the name of his Father.</hi> Now he ſaith that it is a <hi>new ſong,</hi> the which onely the ſealed can learne. It is, I ſay, that rendring of honour and prayſe for the benefits of God and the Lambe, the which the Elders and multitude clothed in white, aſcribed unto them in Chap. 5. &amp; Chap. 7. <hi>viz.</hi> their ſincere faith and confidence in God and the Lambe joyned with a continuall celebration and thankſgiving. By this ſigne the worſhippers of the Lamb are ſeparated from the <hi>followers of the Beast.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, it appeareth that this <hi>ſeale</hi> is attained and imprinted in the foreheads of the Saints in this life: It is attained, I ſay, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>by learning,</hi> without which we cannot have it, and for to learne it, we muſt continually exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe our ſelves in the reading, meditating, and hearkning unto the word of God, and calling upon his name. And hence the benefit and worth of the miniſtery is commended, as being the meanes by which we come to know this <hi>new ſong,</hi> even while we are here in this life: for in the world to come there ſhall be no uſe of inſtructing, but all ſhall be <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>taught of God.</hi> Moreover it hence appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that this multitude belongs to the Church militant, who by learning the <hi>new ſong of the harpers,</hi> ſhall alſo at length ſtand before the throne, and be joyned unto the Saints triumphant in heaven, as we ſhall ſee in verſ. 5.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Theſe were redeemed from the earth</hi>] Gr. <gap reason="foreign">

<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18</note> 
                        <hi>Peter</hi> excellently interpreteth this place, Chap. 1.18. <hi>Knowing that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as ſilver &amp; gold from your vaine converſation received by tradition from your fathers: but by the precious blood of Chriſt, as of a Lamb without blemiſh, and without spot.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſame benefit of redemption the Elders celebrate, Chap. 5.9. <hi>Thou hast re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us to our God by thy blood.</hi> And indeed this benefit we enjoy in this life: for now, as many as through faith, are <hi>ſealed</hi> in the blood of the Lamb, are redeemed; howbeit the fulneſſe of our redemption is reſerved to the life to come.</p>
                     <p>But are not all redeemed by Chriſt, dyed he not for all?
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</note> ſaith not the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> that he bought the <hi>falſe prophets,</hi> by whom he is denyed?

                        </gap> of the price: which would ſuffice for the redemption of all men, if all by faith did receive
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:96676:192"/>the benefit offered. But as many as paſſe the time of their being in this life in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, they remaine unredeemed through their own fault. The <hi>ſealed</hi> therefore are onely redeemed, becauſe they alone by faith receive the grace of redemption, through the grace of election, which God vouchſafed them (not to the others) from all eternity.</p>

                        <hi>Theſe are they who are not defiled with women</hi>] Their third commendation is <hi>Chastity:</hi>

                     <p>The ancient hereticks called <hi>Hieracites</hi> urging the letter,
<note place="margin">The depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of this place by the hiera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites.</note> forbad matrimony, as an uncleane thing, and hence eſtabliſhed the merits of virginity: becauſe, ſaid they, they who are not defiled with women, that is, unmarried perſons onely, <hi>ſhall follow the Lamb whether ſoever he goeth.</hi> Thus they expounded it litterally: The ſame thing <hi>Tertullian</hi> alſo affirmed, and after him <hi>Jerom</hi> who though he did not condemne marriage, yet he called it <hi>a pollution,</hi> lifting up the merits of virginity into heaven: for beſides innumerable ſcoffes in deteſtation of matrimony, he alſo wreſts this place againſt <hi>Jovinian,</hi> who taught that virginity was of no greater merit before God then matrimony, his words are theſe: <hi>Leſt we ſhould thinke, that they are ſaid not to be defiled with women, who abſtaine from fornication, therefore he addes, for they are virgines: By the undefiled therefore he underſtandeth ſuch as have no wives, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines ſuch as have no husbands. Therefore it ſhall be the merit of virginity to follow the Lamb whitherſoever he goeth: where the married cannot follow him.</hi> This <hi>Ribera</hi> alſo is not aſhamed to maintaine.</p>
                     <p>But it may be clearely ſhewed that this place ſerves neither to diſgrace marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age eſtate,
<note place="margin">The vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this place</note> nor to eſtabliſh the merit of corporal virginity.</p>

                     <p>

                     <p>What then? It is certaine the chaſtity of the <hi>ſealed</hi> is commended:
<note place="margin">The chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of body and minde is praiſed</note> And it is twofold, <hi>viz.</hi> of body and ſpirit, and both may be here underſtood: If of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the ſence will be, <hi>Theſe are not defiled with women,</hi> that is, by unlawfull co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation: for no man appertaines to the company of the <hi>ſealed,</hi> but ſuch as are chaſte, whither in widdowhood, married or unmarried eſtate: not that none of the <hi>ſealed</hi> have ever beene defiled, as may be ſeene in <hi>Lot, Judah, David, Magdalene, &amp;c.</hi> but becauſe through faith they have purged themſelves in the blood of the Lambe before their departure out of this life.</p>
                     <p>But if it be underſtood of ſpirituall Chaſtity, the <hi>ſealed</hi> are ſaid <hi>not to be polluted with women,</hi> that is, with idolatry, which is <hi>spirituall fornication,</hi> but they are vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, to wit, in ſpirit and faith.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Austin</hi> interpreteth it: <hi>They have not defiled themſelves with women, that is, have renounced carnall lusts, nor cleaved to idols, ſtrange gods, hereſies, errours, and wicked workes, but are spirituall virgines, of whom Chriſt is the Bridegrome.</hi> So <hi>Ambroſe</hi> on the words of the Apoſtle, 2 Cor. 11.2. <hi>I have prepared you for one husband, that I may preſent you as a chast virgine to Chriſt: he will have them,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to be virgines in faith, ſuch undefiled ones as</hi> Iohn <hi>in the Revelation doth aſſigne to Christ in the day of judgement: Theſe are they who have not defiled themſelves with women; for they are vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, theſe follow, &amp;c.</hi>

                        <hi>with women, he interprets metaphorically, with errours or hereſies. By women,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>he ſignifieth errour, becauſe errour began by the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: As before in Cha.</hi> 3. <hi>by the woman</hi> Ieſabel <hi>he underſtood idolatry, by which the manners and verity of faith are corrupted: for if thou ſo understand women, to thinke that therefore they are ſaid to be Virgines, becauſe they have kept their bodies untouched, thou excludeſt the Saints from this grace, who all of them had wives, the Apoſtles</hi> Iohn <hi>and</hi> Paul <hi>onely excepted.</hi> By which he directly refutes <hi>Tertullian, Jerom,</hi> and <hi>Riberas</hi> depravation of this place, as being abſurd and wicked. To whom <hi>Alcaſar</hi> alſo conſenteth, underſtanding <hi>virginity</hi> here metaphorically of the integrity of life and doctrine, and all ſuch to be virgines who defile not themſelves with an inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate love of the creature.</p>
                     <p>But the obſervation of our <hi>Toſſanus</hi> doth much delight me, that here is an <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titheſis</hi> betwixt the faithfull, and the inhabitants of the earth, who have committed fornication with the <hi>Babyloniſh Whore</hi> making the ſence to be thus. <hi>Theſe ſigned ones are not defiled with women,</hi> that is, <hi>they have not committed fornication with the great Whore, but are virgines perſevering in the faith and ſincere worſhip of Chriſt.</hi>

                     <p>To all theſe I adde (which notwithſtanding comes all to one thing) that this title is to be compared with that in Chap. 7. <hi>Theſe are they which have waſhed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</hi> He ſpeakes, I ſay the ſame thing here in other words: <hi>Theſe are they which have not defiled themſelves with women, for they are virgines.</hi> Our robes are carnall concupiſcences, theſe muſt be waſhed and made white in the blood of Chriſt through the remiſſion of ſinnes, and <hi>white robes</hi> put on by the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe and ſanctification of the

Who theſe are, and to what times the propheſie appertaines, is much queſtioned, All agree in this, that theſe <hi>Angels</hi> repreſent the Preachers of the Goſpell in the times of Antichriſt. But Popiſh expoſitours referre the ſame to the laſt foure years of the world, in which time they abſurdly imagine that Antichriſt ſhall beare the ſway. For how ſhould all thoſe things which are treated of touching the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and the <hi>Whore</hi> from the 13. Chap. unto the end almoſt of the whole Book, be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in ſo ſhort a ſpace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ribera</hi> ſuppoſeth they are three renowned Preachers of the Goſpell in the time of Antichriſt.

<pb n="338" facs="tcp:96676:194"/>writers of holy Scripture, <hi>Peter, Paul,</hi> and <hi>John:</hi> The which fooliſh fiction is refuted by the very naming of it.</p>
                     <p>Our interpreters doe generally acknowledge that theſe things appertain to the times of the reformation of the Church: but by what occaſion this viſion is here againe demonſtrated, ſeeing it was before foretold in Chap. 11. touching <hi>the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring of the temple,</hi> they expound not.</p>
                     <p>By our Method it is plaine, ſeeing here we handle the <hi>Third Act</hi> of this viſion, that theſe things are to be compared with the <hi>Third Act</hi> of the foregoing viſion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In the ſecond viſion</hi> indeed, there was nothing anſwering to this, becauſe there onely the preſervation of the ſealed or elect under Antichriſt was manifeſted to <hi>Iohn,</hi> the which is here alſo treated of in the firſt part of this Chapter.</p>
                     <p>But in the <hi>third viſion</hi> we have the <hi>meaſuring of the temple,</hi> and the <hi>propheſie of the two witneſſes,</hi> Chapter 11. repreſenting unto us the reformation of the Church that ſhould be in the laſt times, unto which therefore we are to returne: for the <hi>two,</hi> that is, a few propheſying witneſſes there mentioned, are here ſaid to be <hi>three preaching Angels,</hi> that is, they are more then before. And this very thing <hi>Anſelmus,</hi> as <hi>Ribera</hi> reports, acknowledgeth, taking the <hi>firſt</hi> Angell to be <hi>Elias:</hi> the <hi>ſecond</hi> another Prophet and companion of him: rightly indeed according to the ſcope, but he erres in the perſons. But as before we ſhewed that the <hi>meaſuring of the temple</hi> began about the time of the <hi>Councell of Conſtance,</hi> or a little before: ſo without doubt theſe <hi>three Angels</hi> began to preach from that time forward: whoſe miniſtery no ſooner ſhall be ended, but the <hi>Beast</hi> ſhall be thruſt into utter deſtruction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I ſaw another Angell flying</hi>] No Angell had gone before: Therefore he was not one of the <hi>Harpers,</hi> or of the multitude of ſealed ones. Which ſignifies, that from this time another ſtate of the Church was to be looked for: An <hi>Angell</hi>] that is, a Preacher of the Goſpell, as before <hi>in Viſion first,</hi> the ſingular number (by an enallage) being put for the plurall: for there ſhould not be one onely but more, although at the firſt but few ſhould zealouſly ſet themſelves upon the worke of reformation.

                     <p>Adde to theſe all the <hi>witneſſes of the truth,</hi> which are recorded in the <hi>Catalogue of witneſſes,</hi> Tom. 2. lib. 19. Now let us conſider the actions of this Angell.</p>
                     <p>He flyeth <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <hi>in the middeſt of heaven</hi>] Like to the Angell who Chap 8.13. proclaimed <hi>woe to the world,</hi> but this here is more proſperous, for he publiſheth not woes, but the everlaſting Goſpell.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Middest of heaven</hi>] that is, ſay ſome, through the middeſt of the Church: <hi>Others</hi> openly, ſo as he might be ſeen and heard of al, like as ſuch things are conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous which appear in the middle of heaven. For however the foreſaid preachers remained in their places and Churches, yet their doctrine and writings were ſpread through the whole Church. <hi>Brightmans</hi> conjecture I diſlike not, that by this <hi>fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> betwixt both is ſignified the imperfection of the doctrine firſt publiſhed by theſe teachers: for however they ſaw and reproved the groſſer ſort of errours in Popery, yet in many things they clave unto the dregs of earthly rudiments, ſo as they could not with full flight ſoare up into the higheſt heaven: for as a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a ſudden brought forth into the light, who along while was in darkeneſſe, lookes upon all things with dazeling eyes: ſo they who many ages together were kept in the darkeneſſe of Popery, could not behold the light of the Goſpell, but with dimme eyes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Having the everlaſting Gospell</hi>] The meſſage or thing publiſhed by this Angell he ſets forth by an excellent title, calling it <hi>the everlaſting Gospell:</hi> by which is declared the authority, effect and conſtancie thereof. Antichriſt indeed will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne this his preaching and writings as haereticall and full of poyſon, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour by the authority of Councils to repreſſe and refute them, not by arguments, but by fire and ſword. So did he to <hi>Wickleffe,</hi> whom firſt he greevouſly vexed by the Maſters of Schooles: and afterward thruſting him out of <hi>England</hi> into <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia</hi> (though he were againe recalled by the King) he miſerably perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him untill his dying day. Nevertheleſſe he went on conſtantly in teaching and writing: And after his death the <hi>Councill of Conſtance</hi> cauſed his body to be taken out of the grave, and together with his Writings to be conſumed with fire.</p>
                     <p>The like they did to the two witneſſes <hi>John Huſſe,</hi> and <hi>Ierome of Prague,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning, oppreſſing &amp; burning them as haereticks with their books and doctrines. Now howſoever the Beaſt affrighted the world with this tyranny, and kept the ſame a while under his yoke: nevertheleſſe he gained nothing by it. For there remained ſome remnants in <hi>England,</hi> and Churches in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> who conſtantly maintained the doctrine of thoſe Martyrs untill this day.
<note place="margin">The ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell could not be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</note> For it was the Goſpell brought by the Son of God out of the boſome of the everlaſting Father, to wit glad tidings of the remiſſion of ſin, righteouſnes and life eternall freely to be given through the faith of Chriſt. The Goſpell, I ſay, not of yeſterdayes riſing, as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt calumniates, but <hi>everlasting,</hi> revealed indeed from the begnining to the Fathers and Prophets: but at length fully manifeſted and conſummated by the Son of God, and henceforward ſhall remaine eternally. Whatſoever therefore the Beaſt and his ſophiſters indeavour and bable to the contrary, yet they ſhall never be able to overthrow and ſuppreſſe the ſame.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To preach unto the inhabiants of the earth</hi>] The effects and lawfull calling of
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:96676:195"/>theſe teachers is here maintained,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>The lawful calling of Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Gal.</hi> 1.7.</note> touching which if Antichriſt ſhall plauſibly moue any queſtion, as from whom they received this new Goſpell? what Church before them held this faith? by what miracles they can prove their calling, &amp;c?</p>
                     <p>The holy Ghoſt anſwereth: <hi>They have the everlaſting Goſpell:</hi> The which is one onely received from Chriſt and the Apoſtles, and of old abundantly confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by miracles, ſo that there is no uſe of new: And they have it, to evangelize the ſame, that is to declare and preach it to the inhabitants of the earth. They have therefore a lawfull calling to teach in the Church.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To them that dwell on the earth</hi>] Thus the followers and worſhippers of the Beaſt, the adverſaries of Chriſt are continually called.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then the difficulty of their charge is intimated, they muſt have to doe with the <hi>inhabitants of the earth,</hi> groſſe and earthly men, ſuperſtitious maintainers of Antichriſtian idolatry, obſtinate adverſaries, from whom they ſhall ſuffer grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous contradiction.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the ſucceſſe of their doctrine is noted, not to be very great. They ſhall labour indeed to reforme the Papacy,
<note place="margin">Caecis ſabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam canent, Aethiopes lavabunt.</note> to call the blinde unto the light: but according to the proverb: they ſhall ſing to the deafe, and waſh Black-moores: becauſe Antichriſt will reſiſt them by all meanes poſſible, and labour to keep his kingdome in peace: And indeed it ſhall be ſo by the juſt judgement of God. For becauſe the world rather loveth lies then truth: <hi>God ſhall ſend them ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion, that they ſhould beleeve a lie: that they all might periſh, who have not received the love of the truth,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.11.</p>
                     <p>The conſideration hereof ſerves both to illuſtrate the goodneſſe of God, who graciouſly cauſed <hi>the everlaſting Gospel to be preached unto the inhabitants of the earth,</hi> that is, the ſworne vaſſals of Antichriſt drowned in ſuperſtitions and idolatry: <hi>As alſo</hi> to leſſen the ſcandall that we be not offended at the ſmall ſucceſſe the Goſpel then had at that time. For what wonder was it, that the <hi>inhabitants of the earth</hi> received not the ſame, who were accuſtomed to heare and beleeve nothing but the dreames and lies of Antichriſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And to every nation and tribe</hi>] This partition is taken from Chap. 13.7. ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying that the fame of this Goſpell ſhould be ſpread as farre as the Papacy did extend. For however thoſe teachers ſhould remaine in their places: yet their doctrine by their writings was made knowne every where, and found adverſaries in all places.</p>
                     <p>Before I goe further let us here take notice of one thing touching the devils ſubtilty.
<note place="margin">Cyrillus fei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a new goſpell.</note> We finde by hiſtory, that a little before God raiſed up this Angell in <hi>England,</hi> the devill had begun to ſpread abroad his <hi>eternall gospell</hi> through one <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillus</hi> a carmelite Monke, conſiſting of moſt foule errours, and monſtrous opinions, pretending that it was the <hi>everlaſting gospell</hi> of this Angell. And indeed the Monkes under pretext of this propheſie did readily imbrace the ſame: becauſe he confirmed their monaſticall rites, rules, ſuperſtitions, and fables. He taught that the Goſpell of Chriſt was to remaine unto this time, but thence forward his <hi>new Goſpel</hi> was to take place in the Church. This was a wicked depravation of this propheſie,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.25 <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.25. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8.</note> and blaſphemie againſt the expreſſe word of God: <hi>The word of the Lord remaineth foe ever. This is the word of faith which we preach. Hold faſt that which yee have, till I come. If an Angel from heaven preach any other Goſpell let him be accurſed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this ungodly fiction many learned of that age oppoſed themſelves, inſomuch that <hi>Pope Innocent</hi> himſelfe was forced by the <hi>Lateran Council</hi> to condemne this impudent aſſertion: becauſe it alſo touched the Popes kingdome. Some ſay <hi>Joa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chim</hi> the Abbot was the broacher hereof: but it is falſe. See <hi>Centur. Eccleſiaſt.</hi> 13. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.</p>
                     <p>To diſcover therefore the impoſture of the Devill, the Lord began to bring to light in the ſame age the <hi>everlaſting Goſpell</hi> here propheſied of, by <hi>Wickleffe</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and by other teachers in other places. We may eaſily Iudge which of theſe
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:96676:195"/>two was that everlaſting and true Goſpell. For the one aboliſhed the Goſpel of Chriſt, and writings of the Apoſtles: The other brought forth the ſame out of darkneſſe. The former therefore was falſe, the latter true.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Saying with a great voice</hi>] The zeale of the Angell in publiſhing the Goſpell is commended. And indeed the foreſaid teachers performed their office with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied labour and paines both in teaching, preaching, &amp; diſputing: for when they came into the world, the world was in a deep lethargie of ſuperſtitions, drunken &amp; buried in the wine of the wrath of Babyloniſh fornication: So that they were forced <hi>to cry aloud</hi> ſo mightily, to the end that they might be heard of the drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy (or rather deafe) <hi>inhabitants of the earth.</hi> This voice is to be underſtood not onely of their preaching, but writings alſo, by which they manifeſted the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>everlaſting Goſpell.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Feare God</hi>] The argument of his preaching hath three parts: yet the whole is doctrinall and hortatory. The firſt part is the <hi>feare of God,</hi> which is <hi>the beginning of wiſdome.</hi> Here rightly the teachers begin. Sometimes by it the whole worſhip, but here properly is ſignified that part of worſhip which conſiſts in the true knowledge and reverence of God: and it is oppoſed both to the carnall ſecurity of the whole world, whence ariſeth prophaneneſſe and the wicked contempt of God: as alſo to the prepoſterous feare, by which Antichriſt hath along time kept the world under his yoake. Both theſe I will briefly now expound.</p>
                     <p>The Papacy did abound with ſecurity and feare.
<note place="margin">Security &amp; feare in the Papacy.</note> This carnall ſecurity was fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered by their bewitching confeſſions, abſolutions, ſatisfactions, Maſſes, indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, &amp;c. No wicked act how great ſoever, but by money, and ſuch remedies might be expiated: Hence Gods judgement, neither was, or to this day is feared in the Papacy: as having preſent remedy for their ſins in their confeſſions, ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and indulgences. Hence ſpringeth that bruitiſh ſecurity and liberty to ſin.</p>
                     <p>So againe the feare of Antichriſt hath, and ſtill doth vex the world: becauſe it is held a greater offence to neglect the edicts of the Pope, then to violate the commandements of God. So that they were eaſily frighted with the feare of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, poenall ſatisfactions, purgatory, &amp;c. inſomuch as Emperours and Kings were forced to kiſſe the feet of Antichriſt, yea all both great and ſmal did tremblinglie ſubmit to his beck. Now this <hi>Angell</hi> recalling the world both from this prophane ſecurity, as alſo from their prepoſterous feare, bids them, FEARE GOD, <hi>not the Beaſt:</hi> for it is not the <hi>Beaſt</hi> but God that can caſt both ſoule and body into hell fire, <hi>Math.</hi> 10.28.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And give glory to him</hi>] Secondly, he requires faith and obedience unto the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: for then is the glory of Gods truth, goodnes and power truely attributed unto him, when his word is received by faith, and performed in obedience. <hi>In the former member</hi> the Angel prepared the world for the Goſpell, becauſe without the feare of God, that is, ſo long as prophaneſſe and contempt of God doth reigne, there the Goſpell findes no place. By this <hi>other member,</hi> he inſtructs them thus prepared, to <hi>give glory to God</hi> by receiving his word in faith, and conforme their life according to his commandements. And indeed this is all God requires of us. So Moſes: <hi>And now O Iſrael, what doth Jehovah thy God require of thee,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.12</note> ſave that thou feare Jehovah thy God, and walke in all his waies, and love him with all thy heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For the houre of his judgement is come</hi>] A reaſon confirming what he had ſaid, is taken from threatning of judgement at hand: the ſerious conſideration whereof will recall a man from his carnall ſecurity to the feare of God and working of righteouſneſſe, except he have a heart of ſteele, for as much as in the day of Gods judgement, a moſt exact account of what hath been done in the fleſh muſt be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by all, the greateſt Kings and Potentates not excepted. <hi>When without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſons they that have done well ſhall poſſeſſe life eternall: They that have done ill ſhall be caſt into everlasting fire.</hi> The Angell therefore could not uſe a more forcible reaſon, to deterre men from the contempt of God and his word. To this purpoſe
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:96676:196"/>is that in Sirach,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.40</note> 
                        <hi>In all things that thou ſayeſt or doeſt, remember thy end, and thou ſhalt not ſin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now if any aske how this propheſie is true and accompliſhed, ſeeing it is ſo long ſince <hi>John</hi> ſaid,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9.</note> 
                        <hi>Gods judgement was at hand?</hi> Let him heare <hi>Peter</hi> anſwering the mockers of his time. <hi>The Lord is not ſlacke concerning his promiſe (as ſome count ſlackneſſe) but is long ſuffering towards us, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come unto repentance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Angell ſaith <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>is come,</hi> for, ſhall certainly come, by an uſuall <hi>Enallage</hi> of the preterperfect tenſe inſtead of the future, ſo a little after, <hi>is fallen,</hi> for, <hi>ſhall certainely fal,</hi> noting the immutability of the events decreed by God: ſo formerly he often ſaid, <hi>he will come ſhortly,</hi> that is, ſooner then we are aware of, that the deepe fleepe of ſecurity might be driven out of us, and leſt with the wicked ſervant we ſhould ſay,

                        <hi>My Lord deferreth his comming:</hi> But rather let us conſider ſeeing the Apoſtles did preſage the day of judgement to be then at hand, how much nearer is it now unto us after ſo many ages.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And worſhip him that made] In the third member,</hi> he recalls the world from po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh idolatry, unto the ſervice of the true God alone: whom he notes by a peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſis from the worke of the creation of heaven and earth, the ſea, and fountaines of waters: The <hi>Old verſion</hi> ads, <hi>and of all things that are in them:</hi> which words are not in the Greeke: but ſeem to be taken out of Pſa. 146.9. unto which place the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit here alludeth. <hi>The fountaines of waters</hi> are reckoned up among the chiefe works of God, becauſe the continuance of the fountaines is indeed a very wonderfull worke of the Lord: concerning which Phyloſophers have much diſputed with great admiration:
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 114 8.</note> And it is alſo celebrated in the Pſalmes: <hi>He ſendeth the springs into the valleyes, which run among the hills. Which turneth the rock into a ſtanding wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the flint into a fountaine of waters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Furthermore, that religious worſhip is onely due to God, both the Scripture and nature it ſelfe teacheth. For God alone is omnipotent, knowes all things, and is preſent in all places. He is able to heare and helpe all that call upon him whereſoever they be. He alone is the Author of nature, governour and Lord of the world: wherefore all ought to depend upon him onely, in him alone we muſt beleeve and put our conſidence.

                     </p>
                     <p>Now howſoever this be an undeniable and manifeſt truth, yet the world for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking the Lord, followed and wondred after the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> all (I ſay) both great and ſmall, bond and free, worſhipped the <hi>Beaſts image:</hi> kiſſed his feet, and attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted divine honour unto him, as though he were God on earth: And this the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of the Pope doe not denie: according to that of the Poet before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned:

                     <p>Now this <hi>Angel,</hi> if we looke into hiſtories, who can he be ſave <hi>Luther?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">This ſecond Angell is Luther.</note> who followed 130. yeeres after <hi>Wickleffe:</hi> and 100. after <hi>Huſſe</hi> and <hi>Jerome:</hi> he firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in <hi>Saxony,</hi> by word and writing, to thunder againſt the Popes Pardons pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely put to ſale: ſoon after againſt the whole Papacy, <hi>anno</hi> 1517.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Babylon is fallen, is fallen</hi>] He threatens ruine to <hi>Babylon</hi> for her wicked forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, by which as with a peſtilent plague, ſhe had infected the Chriſtian world, her horrible idolatry (I ſay) and cruelty, by which ſhe defiled and oppreſſed the Church. The commination is taken out of Iſai. 21.9. <hi>Babylon is fallen, is fallen, and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground.</hi> And Ier. 51.8. <hi>Babylon is ſuddenly fallen and deſtroyed, howle for her:</hi> In which words the Prophets threaten ruine to Babylon of the Caldeans, which had grievouſly preſſed Gods people by 70. yeares captivity.</p>
                     <p>Now it may be demanded whither this <hi>Babylon</hi> here threatned, be the foreſaid <hi>Chaldaean Babylon,</hi> or another, and which?</p>
                     <p>That it is not <hi>Babylon of Chaldea</hi> appeares by many reaſons.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that Babylon neither was is, or ſhall be the <hi>Seat of Antichriſt.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">This is not the Caldea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Babylon.</note> For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there be an ancient fable of Antichriſts riſing out of Babylon: yet the ſame makes not <hi>Babylon</hi> but <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to be his ſeat. Now the <hi>Babylon</hi> here threatned by the Angell, ſhall be the <hi>Seat of Antichriſt</hi> by the conſent of all interpreters.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> This <hi>Babylon</hi> is that <hi>great city,</hi> the which in <hi>Johns</hi> time ruled over the Kings of the earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.18. But then the Caldeans held not the Monarchie, but the Romanes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Beſides</hi> this <hi>Babylon</hi> defiles <hi>all nations of the earth with her fornication.</hi> But now, how the <hi>Caldean Babylon</hi> ſhould ſo doe in theſe laſt times no ſound reaſon can be given for it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Laſtly,</hi> the people of God are bid <hi>to goe out of this Babylon,</hi> Chapter 18.4. But Gods people for theſe thouſand yeeres have not been, nor ſhall be in the Eaſterne Babylon, &amp;c. Therefore this <hi>Babylon,</hi> is not Babylon in Caldea, although the holy Ghoſt doth apply the propheticall threatnings of old againſt Babylon, to good purpoſe and fitly here.
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:96676:197"/>from the letter therefore wee muſt neceſſarily come to the figure, which thing <hi>Ribera</hi> alſo acknowledgeth.</p>
                     <p>Now ſecondly ſome of the Ancients will have this <hi>Babylon</hi> to be the <hi>world,</hi> as being the <hi>great city</hi> of the wicked, in which the Devill ruleth: So <hi>Ambroſe, Bede, Arethas, Andreas, Ansbertus, Haymo, Primaſius, Anſelmus, &amp;c.</hi> But this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot ſtand.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For first,</hi> This <hi>Babylon</hi> is that <hi>Great whore</hi> making drunke the inhabitants of the earth with the wine of her fornication. But how ſhall the world make drunke the inhabitants of the earth, ſeeing themſelves are the world made drunke by the whore? ſhall the world make the world drunke? the whore therefore which maketh drunke is plainely diſtinguiſhed from the inhabitants of the earth, who are made drunke.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> the ſence would be abſurd: <hi>Babylon is fallen,</hi> that is, <hi>the world is fallen:</hi> for by the ruine of Babylon the whole world ſhal not decay, but there ſhal remain Kings, and merchants, which ſhall ſee and bewaile the ruine of <hi>Babylon:</hi> whereas after the ruine of the world there wil be no kings nor marchants.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> we are commanded to <hi>goe out of this Babylon,</hi> Chap. 16.8. But we are not bid to goe out of the world, 1 Cor. 5.10. except in a ſpirituall ſence. But out of this Babylon a locall departure is commanded.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> it is the common opinion that <hi>John</hi> propheſieth of that <hi>Babylon,</hi> which is <hi>the ſeat of Antichriſt.</hi> But the whole world ſhall not be <hi>Antichriſts ſeat:</hi> For he ſhall <hi>ſit in the temple of God,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.5. the which cannot be meant of the whole world.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, the deſcription and ſituation of this <hi>great citie</hi> agrees not ſo fully to any as to <hi>Rome:</hi> for it is ſaid to ſtand upon <hi>ſeven Mountaines,</hi> which cannot ſo well be ſaid of any city as of Rome, built of old by <hi>Romulus</hi> on ſeven hills, named <hi>Palatinus Quirinalis, Aventinus, Coelius, Viminalis, Aeſquilinus, Janicularis:</hi> Hence Virgil., lib. 6.

                     <p>Beſides this <hi>great citie Babylon</hi> in <hi>Johns</hi> time,
<note place="margin">Having rule over the world.</note> had dominion over the Kings of the earth, Chap. 17.18. and no city then but Rome, had monarchicall power.</p>
                     <p>But we need no further proofe, ſeeing this opinion is backt with the authority of many Ancient writers,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Bellar. li.</hi> 2. <hi>de P. R.</hi> 1. <hi>Rib. in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poc.</hi> 14. <hi>ſ.</hi> 39. <hi>A lca pag.</hi> 721.</note> nay the Ieſuites themſelves (<hi>Alcaſar</hi> not excepted) do not now oppoſe the ſame. Yet leſt they ſhould any waies prejudice their Pope, they feine that by <hi>Babylon</hi> here is meant, not Chriſtian Rome, as it hath been more then a thouſand yeers under the government of holy Popes: But heatheniſh Rome, as of old it was under Emperours.</p>
                     <p>But it will eaſily appeare, that this is a vaine evaſion. For firſt, Heatheniſh Rome, was not the ſeat of Antichriſt, touching which ſeat (as all conſent) <hi>Iohn</hi> here propheſieth off Neither was Antichriſt come, ſo long as Rome remained heatheniſh: Therefore the former Rome is not this Babylon.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It cannot be underſtood of the <hi>Old,</hi> but Popiſh Rome,
<note place="margin">Babylon is no Pagan but Popish Rome.</note> that ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is who hath <hi>made drunke all the inhabitants of the earth, with the wine of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,</hi> and that all the Kings of the earth have committed fornication with her. For <hi>Old Rome,</hi> however it did abound with moſt foule idolatry: Yet ſhe alwaies gave liberty to all nations ſubjected to her, for to exerciſe their owne religions and ſuperſtitions, yea ſuffered the gods of all other people to be ſet up and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped even in <hi>Rome,</hi> Chriſt onely excepted, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> records out of <hi>Tertullian.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be proved by any hiſtory that <hi>ancient Rome</hi> forced their worſhip on for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine people: whereas on the contrary <hi>Popiſh Rome</hi> compelleth and impoſeth on all nations and kings her ſuperſtitious and idolatrous worſhip on paine of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, ſeeking to be eſteemed the Mother of Churches, and in very deed the whole Eaſt lucked their abominations and idolatries from her as from the paps of a mother.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In the time of the Fathers before alledged, <hi>Tertullian</hi> excepted, <hi>Rome</hi> was no longer heatheniſh, being under the power of Chriſtian Emperours: and yet they call her Babylon: Therefore they underſtood it not of heatheniſh Rome, ſuch as it was not, but of Chriſtian Rome, ſuch as then it was.</p>

                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That <hi>Rome</hi> is Babylon, of which it is here ſaid: <hi>It is fallen, it is fallen:</hi> and which was to be deſtroyed in the latter times. But the ruine of heatheniſh Rome is not here publiſhed (as <hi>Alcaſar</hi> vainely feineth) for that <hi>Rome</hi> is ceaſed long agoe: but the deſtruction of <hi>Popiſh Rome</hi> is yet to come: for it is foretold, to be in the laſt times. Theſe things therefore belong to <hi>Popiſh Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fiftly,</hi> that <hi>Rome</hi> is Babylon, which makes <hi>merchandiſe of the ſoules of men,</hi> Revel. 18.13. Now this beaſtly trade was not driven by heatheniſh <hi>Rome,</hi> but by the <hi>Popiſh Rome,</hi> as we ſhal fee heareafter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lastly,</hi> that <hi>Rome</hi> is <hi>Babylon</hi> out of which in the laſt times Gods people are commanded to goe forth. Now they are not bid to depart out of heatheniſh <hi>Rome,</hi> which hath ceaſed to be long agoe. Neither doe we read that ever any Chriſtians by vertue of this commandement did forſake heatheniſh <hi>Rome,</hi> but did alwaies conſtantly there perſevere even in the times of moſt cruell perſecutions. Gods people therefore are commanded to goe out of Popiſh Rome: Thus we ſee <hi>Rome</hi> is this <hi>Babylon</hi> which muſt be deſtroyed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ribera</hi> the Ieſuite not daring to deny ſo evident a truth, changeth himſelfe into divers ſhapes, to ſalve the Pope.</p>

What inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie hath ſhe done unto them, that they ſhould rejoyce at her puniſhment?</hi> Therefore he concludeth that Babylon here ſpoken of, is to be underſtood of heatheniſh Rome, which perſecuted the Apoſtles and Prophets.</p>
                     <p>But in vaine he ſeekes for pretenſes in ſo cleare a matter. For he granted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the future ſtate of Rome is here ſpoken of, therefore he is contradictory to himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>And as for his objections they are eaſily anſwered.</p>
                     <p>To the firſt it ſufficeth, that <hi>Rome</hi> did then Lord it over all nations, when <hi>John</hi> wrote this booke. The ſame <hi>Rome</hi> the Pope now holdeth. And beſides this even Papall Rome is a moſt wealthy and powerfull city, and the Queen of the world: for all the treaſures and delights of the Chriſtian world, have now long agoe by thouſand enticements been drawn unto Rome alone. She challengeth the Empire of the world unto herſelfe, for ſhe boaſteth that the Emperours and Kings of the earth doe reigne by her favour and benefit. All muſt be vaſſals of Popiſh Rome, yea, if we beleeve the Ieſuits, even in temporall things. <hi>Papall Rome</hi> therefore is Lady of all, and Empreſſe of the world, according to the verſes:
<q xml:lang="lat">
                           <hi>Roma caput mundi, quicquid non poſſidet armis relligione tenet.</hi>

                        <pb n="347" facs="tcp:96676:198"/>
To the ſecond I ſay, that which he pretends is ridiculous, as if becauſe Papiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Rome had not perſecuted the Apoſtles and Prophets: therefore they ought not to rejoyce at her deſtruction: for then alſo the heaven ought not to rejoyce: for was heaven I pray you ſlaine by Papiſtical Rome? Nay, how could heatheniſh Rome kill the Prophets, which never ſaw Rome? Notwithſtanding the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Prophets, and heaven it ſelfe are worthily bid to rejoyce for the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of her, both becauſe in perſecuting the Saints ſhe perſecuteth the Prophets and Apoſtles: as alſo becauſe all creatures ought to rejoyce for the vindicating of Chriſts glory and deſtruction of Antichriſt, whether they have been hurt by him or not. Laſtly, if Popiſh Rome (the which <hi>Ribera</hi> was not afraid to write) ſhall be puniſhed for the wickedneſſe of heatheniſh Rome, which herſelfe hath not committed: Why then may not the Prophets rejoyce for the deſtruction of <hi>Popiſh Rome,</hi> though they were not hurt by her?</p>
                     <p>Vnderſtanding therefore that theſe things cannot be put off,
<note place="margin">Riberas new fection about the Pope.</note> he is forced neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily to grant that <hi>Popiſh Rome</hi> is <hi>Babylon.</hi> Notwithſtanding to keep up the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite of the Pope, he deviſeth a new propheſie, namely, that Rome towards the end of the world, expelling the Pope with all the Catholick Saints, ſhall againe apoſtate to their old wickedneſſe and idolatry. And then indeed Rome ſhall be <hi>Babylon</hi> and the warehouſe of all filthineſſe and idolatry, when ſhe ſhall fall off from the Pope, and expell him thence with all other Chriſtians. Whatſoever ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Iohn</hi> propheſieth touching the ruine, burning and horrible plagues of <hi>Babylon,</hi> appertaines, ſaith he, to <hi>Rome</hi> after that ſhe ſhall have thruſt out the Pope <hi>Chriſts Vicar:</hi> Without which fiction this ſubtil Writer ſaw that the Pope of Rome could not be freed from Antichriſtianiſme: and thinkes by this artificial device to ſhift off this our argument: <hi>He that in the laſt times holds Babylon the ſeat of Antichriſt, is Antichrist. The Romiſh Pope in theſe laſt times holds Babylon</hi> ROME <hi>the ſeat of Antichriſt. Therefore the Romiſh Pope is Antichrist.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The aſſumption</hi> he labours to weaken, not indeed by denying, that <hi>Rome,</hi> which the Pope poſſeſſeth in the laſt times is Babylon: nor alſo that Babylon in the laſt times is the <hi>ſeat of Antichrist:</hi> But by denying that <hi>Rome</hi> now ſo long as it is held by the Pope, is the <hi>ſeat of Antichriſt:</hi> Becauſe <hi>Rome</hi> (as he ſaith) before Antichriſts comming ſhall decline to Paganiſme, and thruſt out the Pope.</p>
                     <p>But O <hi>Ribera,</hi> by what authours, by what Scripture,
<note place="margin">Lyras ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on refuted</note> by what reaſon wilt thou prove unto us this thy new Oracle, or rather dotage, hitherto unheard of even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Papiſts: as, I. That Rome at length ſhall fall from Chriſtianity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to Heatheniſme. II. That ſhe ſhall drive out her moſt holy father the Pope, and give place to Antichriſt.</p>
                     <p>The latter indeed of theſe thou thinkeſt to make out well enough after this manner: <hi>That as long as Rome is obedient to the Pope, ſo great evills cannot befall her: Becauſe the Pope is Chriſts Vicar: And that Rome ſo long as the Pope is preſent, ſhall be the maintainer and mistreſſe of the Apoſtolicall faith, and manſion of piety:</hi> Not therfore to be deſtroyed, before the Pope be driven thence. But O friend, thou ſeeſt not how often thou doſt beg the queſtion, and how many things thou takeſt for granted not onely doubtfull unto us, but alſo incredible to the Papiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                     <p>I let paſſe thy common aſſertion that the Pope is <hi>Chriſts Vicar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thou muſt prove I. That <hi>Babylon and Rome</hi> to be ruinated, is to fall to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſme. Certainely herein thou haſt <hi>Alcaſar</hi> oppoſing thee, who on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary faineth more abſurdly, that Romes ruine is her converſion to Chriſtianity.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. That Rome having the Pope preſent with her,
<note place="margin">Roma eſt jam tota Lupanar.</note> is the miſtreſſe of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall faith, and manſion houſe of godlineſſe, of which it was long agoe truely ſaid: <hi>Rome is now wholy a Brothelhouſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">III. That Rome the moſt holy citie having her Pope and Cardinals there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent (but perhaps fallen into a fatall Lethargie) ſhould caſt off the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and decline to the idols of the Heathens.</p>

                        <pb n="348" facs="tcp:96676:199"/>
IV. That Rome being thus fallen to heatheniſme, the Pope with his Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls ſhall miſerably be deprived and thruſt out of the <hi>ſeat</hi> and patrimony of Saint <hi>Peter.</hi> Now unleſſe theſe things be ſolidly proved by thee, all men may ſee that our argument ſtands firme, and proves <hi>the Pope to be Antichrist.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To the <hi>firſt,
<note place="margin">Riberas reaſons touching Romes fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away examined.</note> ſecond,</hi> and <hi>fourth, Ribera</hi> ſaith nothing. But the <hi>third</hi> (of Romes declining from Chriſtianity to Pagan idolarry) he indeavours to prove by ſome reaſons.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. He ſaith, that the place of ancient Rome, was of old ſtained with abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wickedneſſe: and therefore of neceſſity ſhe muſt one time or other be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by fire.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>firſt,</hi> he may as eaſily prove the apoſtacy of the whole Chriſtian world un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heatheniſme. For we know that of old the whole world was full of abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wickedneſſe. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that which he ſaith touching the defilement of ancient Rome is true indeed. But I wonder how any can without <hi>crimen laeſae majeſtatis</hi> object unto the Popes holineſſe, that the guiltineſſe of ancient Rome ſhould not yet be expiated by the religion and holineſſe of ſo many ages. What? have not ſo many Proceſſions, Maſſes, Conſecrations, Prayers, ſo many merits of holy Popes for theſe thouſand yeeres, been able to purge away the defilement of ancient Rome? Beſides what can be more contumeliouſly ſpoken, then that the Pope the <hi>moſt holy Vicar of Chriſt,</hi> ſhould have his ſeat in a place defiled with ſuch horrible wickedneſſe and offences?
<note place="margin">Ribera con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts himſelfe.</note> And how doth this agree with what thou ſaidſt before, that Rome under the government of her Pope is the manſion of piety, if ſo be that as yet it be not purged from its old guilt and defilement. Let <hi>Ribera</hi> looke to it, how herein he may anſwer the Popes holineſſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. He ſaith, that there are many to this day at Rome who boaſt that they are of the name and ſtock of the old Romanes: And therefore it is probable that they ſhall againe fall to the idolatry and wickedneſſe of their Anceſtours, and ſo be deſtroyed.</p>
                     <p>But this alſo is altogether frivolous, and a moſt injurious infamie and accuſation of the noble families of Rome. For it is certaine that in <hi>Constantines</hi> time there were many more noble families of the pedegree of the ancient Romanes then now, who notwithſtanding forſaking the idolatry of their forefathers, embraced the faith of Chriſt: ſo neither will it neceſſarily follow that the ancient families which yet remaine at Rome, ſhould fall away from Chriſtianity. But put the cauſe they ſhould,
<note place="margin">He argueth the Pope of extream neglect.</note> doth not the Ieſuite herein accuſe the Pope, Cardinals, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and all the Ieſuites which then ſhall live in Rome of extreem negligence, in not performing their duty, but to ſuffer all the people committed to their charge to fall away from the faith of Chriſt. What ſhall all of them fall into ſo dead a ſleep? Or rather now by their impiety and heatheniſh riot, make way to ſuch horrible prophaneneſſe. Let the Ieſuite againe ſee too, how he will anſwer theſe things.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. He ſaith, howbeit they are not of the linnage of the ancient Romanes, yet foraſmuch as they dwell in the ſame city, the which they inhabited, they are to be accounted as one body with them.</p>
                     <p>But by this reaſon the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Cardinals</hi> too, are one body with the Romane Pagans, and guilty of the ſame apoſtacy: ſeeing they alſo dwell at Rome. Thus the Pope ſhould be the head of that body and city, which is one with the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed common-wealth of old Rome. Now the truth is, nothing can be more vainely ſpoken. And I wonder that the Ieſuite when he wrote theſe things, had not conſidered, that he himſelfe lived in <hi>Spaine,</hi> where the ancient Moores former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inhabited.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. He addes from Chap. 16.19, <hi>That Great Babylon came in remembrance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, &amp;</hi> 18.5. <hi>Babylons ſins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembred her iniquities.</hi> Therefore ſaith he, towards the end of the world her old ſins, which hitherto for religion ſake ſeemed to be forgotten, ſhall againe be remembred
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:96676:199"/>and puniſhed becauſe of the new and like tranſgreſſions added to the former.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>firſt,</hi> not onely things done long agoe are ſaid to come in remembrance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, but alſo ſuch things as are newly done: by an <hi>Anthropopatheia:</hi> for ſo in Act. 10. <hi>The prayers and almes of Cornelius,</hi> which he daily performed, are ſaid <hi>to come up for a memoriall before God:</hi> Secondly, albeit his gloſſe were granted: yet there were no need that <hi>new Rome</hi> ſhould be puniſhed for the ſinnes of the old, for as much as <hi>Popiſh Rome</hi> for theſe thouſand years and more hath abounded in all manner of villanies, for which the Lord moſt juſtly may take vengeance on her.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, he flees unto the Oracles of the <hi>Sybills.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But they ſpeak nothing touching the Popes ejection, or apoſtacy of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes from the faith of Chriſt unto Heatheniſme, but only touching the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Rome, therein agreeing with the propheſie of this booke.</p>
                     <p>By all which things it appeareth, that whatſoever the Ieſuite alledgeth for the upholding of the credit of the Pope, it is nothing but a frivolous dotage of a drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming writer.</p>
                     <p>The ſumme of the place is this: That <hi>Babylon</hi> here threatned with deſtruction, is <hi>Rome,</hi> not of the Pagans, which ceaſed in <hi>Constantines</hi> time: Nor <hi>new heatheniſh Rome,</hi> the which (as the Ieſuite feineth) ſhall thruſt out the <hi>Pope:</hi> But <hi>Popiſh Rome</hi> which a long while hath boaſted her ſelfe to be the <hi>Mother of Churches,</hi> and from whoſe breaſts all the nations and kings of the earth have ſucked their errours, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition and idolatry. Thus our inſoluble argument is no way weakned by the Ieſuite, but ſtands firme againſt the <hi>Romiſh Antichrist.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now when we ſpeak of Rome, we underſtand not ſimply the walled city, or palaces, towers and ſtately walkes thereof: but chiefly the Pope himſelfe with his whole kingdom and power over the Weſterne Churches, of which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in Chap. 17.18.</p>
                     <p>Now why is Rome named Babylon?

                        </note> The cauſe may be the likeneſſe that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, of which OROSIUS: <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the riſing of Babylon and Rome is alike: their power is alike, their greatneſſe, times, good things and alſo evill.</hi> But I rather thinke the reaſon is, their likeneſſe in tyrannny and deſtruction. The <hi>old Babylon</hi> afflicted the ancient Church: <hi>Rome</hi> the new Babylon hath op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the new Church. The <hi>Old is fallen:</hi> The <hi>New</hi> ſhall fall. <hi>Babylon is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, is fallen</hi>] The doubling of the threatning denotes the certainty and haſtning of the deſtruction. Therefore alſo it is ſaid in the preterperfect tenſe, <hi>hath,</hi> that is, <hi>is fallen:</hi> becauſe it ſhall certainely and ſuddenly fall: like as we ſay of a dying man, that he is dead, or the like. Neither did the Angell propheſie vainely. For even during the preaching of this Angell, while <hi>Luther,</hi> I ſay, yet taught, a great part of <hi>Babylon</hi> fell both in <hi>Saxony, Germany,</hi> and other neighbouring Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. But touching the deſtruction of Babylon it followes in Chap. 18.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alcaſar</hi> againe by his conſequence is forced to make blacke white, applying the ruine <hi>of Babylon</hi> to the converſion of <hi>heatheniſh Rome</hi> to the faith of Chriſt: making the ſence of the words, <hi>Babylon is fallen, is fallen</hi>] that is, <hi>is converted to Chriſt:</hi> Now who ever heard ſo great an abſurdity? The whole context and conſent of all interpreters evinceth that the ruine of Babylon ſignifies not mercy, but puniſhment: And therefore ſo impudent a depravation of holy Scripture is to be rebuked.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Becauſe ſhe made all nations drinke</hi>] This reaſon evidently refutes <hi>Alcaſars</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity: The cauſe of <hi>Babylons destruction</hi> ſhall be her <hi>fornication,</hi> by which ſhe hath moſt foully defiled her ſelfe, with the Kings and Inhabitants of the earth: for ſhe is the <hi>Mother of all whoredomes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This fornication (as before was ſhewed) is idolatry, by a propheticall and meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical phraſe: for idolaters like harlots do by ſpirituall uncleannes perfidiouſly violate their faith to God, proſtrate themſelves before their Idols, and run head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into utter deſtruction, as we have largely expounded in our Commentary on <hi>Hoſea,</hi> Chap. 1.2.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The ungodly <hi>worſhippers of Babylon and the Beaſt,</hi> he terrifies by threatning of puniſhment, the which the Angell following will denounce more plainely, that if they goe on delighting themſelves with the <hi>wine of fornication,</hi> and to worſhip the Beaſt, they ſhall eternally be tormented with babylon and the Beaſt.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>And the third Angell followed them</hi>] The former Angel denounced <hi>Woe to Babylon.</hi> This terrifies Babylons inhabiters, to the end they might not thinke to be ſcot-free, while Babylon was deſtroyed, but underſtand (that except they left off their fornication) they ſhould be thruſt into eternall deſtruction with her. The <hi>Theſis,</hi> or poſition therefore of this Sermon is very horrible: <hi>viz. That none of the worſhippers of the Beaſt,

Now what their end ſhall be, is here declared unto us by the Angell.</p>
                     <p>Who this Angell ſhould be, the Popiſh Writers mention not, except <hi>Lyra,</hi> who feineth him to be Pope <hi>Gregory.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Who is the third An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell.</note> But this <hi>Angell</hi> was to be after Antichriſts riſing: for he preacheth againſt him. Now <hi>Gregory</hi> was <hi>Antichriſts fore-runner,</hi> viz. of <hi>Boniface III.</hi> who firſt built Babylon by claiming the title of <hi>univerſality.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Angell is ſaid to follow the two former: who denoted all the preachers of the Goſpell, and oppoſers of Popery from <hi>Wickleffe</hi> unto <hi>Luther</hi> and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low labourers: ſo that their miniſtery dured for the ſpace of 175. yeeres, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>Anno</hi> 1371. when <hi>Wickleffe</hi> began to publiſh the <hi>everlasting Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell,</hi> untill the yeere 1546. at what time <hi>Luther</hi> ended his miniſtery, leaving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him this propheticall verſe:

                     </p>
                     <p>This third <hi>Angell</hi> therefore is a figure of all ſuch evangelicall Teachers, who ſince the miniſtery of <hi>Luther</hi> have preached againſt Babylon, and they are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue unto the end of world. For there followes no fourth preaching Angell af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the third: but Chriſt <hi>ſitting on the white cloud comes forth to judgement,</hi> verſ. 14.

                     <p>Now among the number of excellent Teachers, who by word and writing ſince that time have laboured to bring men from popiſh idolatry unto the faith of Chriſt; Of the Germanes, are <hi>Bucer, Capito, Hedio, Brentius, Hyperius, Aleſius, Snepfius,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <p>
                        <hi>If any man worſhip</hi>] This hypothetical commination: <hi>If any man worſhip the Beaſt, the ſame ſhall drinke, &amp;c.</hi> is univerſall, as if he had ſaid. <hi>Whoſoever he be that worſhippeth the Beast, ſhall drinke, &amp;c.</hi> He ſpeaketh hypothetically, to teach us, that the puniſhment may be avoyded, ſo that the condition be obſerved, that is, if a man leave off to worſhip the Beaſt. Whence it appeareth, that not all the worſhippers of the Beaſt ſhall be tormented with theſe plagues, but ſuch onely as alwaies perſevere therein, and repent not, being admoniſhed. Now it ſeemes that this <hi>Hypotheticall</hi> threatning cloſely is oppoſed to the wicked <hi>anathematiſmes of the Beaſt,</hi> which alſo are hypothetically propounded. For example:</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>And in the Councill of Trent,</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Now on the contrary, let the worſhippers of the Beaſt and his image heare the anathema, or curſe of the Angell.</p>

                     <p n="10">10. <hi>The ſame alſo ſhall drinke of the wine of the wrath of God</hi>] The curſe of the wicked is typed out by a propheticall phraſe including the ſinne, for which <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> was threatned by the former Angell. <hi>Babylon</hi> gave her worſhippers to drinke

This is the ſumme of the two following verſes. The firſt member, <hi>here is the patience of the Saints,</hi> is taken out of Chap. 13.10. yet the ſcope is ſomething different. For there it was ſpoken in reſpect of Antichriſts tyranny: the ſence therefore was thus: ſeeing Antichriſts tyranny is ſo great, the Saints ought to prepare themſelves patiently to endure, leſt falling from their conſtancy, they make ſhipwrack of ſalvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Here it is ſpoken with reſpect unto the torments of the Antichriſtians. Hence therefore the holy Ghoſt ſuggeſteth an argument of patience to the Saints, that ſeeing ſo tragicall an end, is certainely to befall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt and his followers, therefore they ought quietly to endure his tyranny, knowing the other are to ſuffer eternall puniſhment for the ſame: which horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſtruction of the adverſaries ought to provoke the Saints to conſtancy.</p>

The <hi>ſecond</hi> oppoſed to the former, contains the conſolation of the godly under the foreſaid conflicts, in the ſame Chapter. The <hi>third</hi> having two parts, repreſents 1. Antichriſts perſecutions, which from his firſt riſing till now have continued more then a thouſand yeeres, Chap. 13. 2. The Churches preſervation under the ſame, and alſo her future purging from the dreges of Antichriſt in the laſt times. Chap. 14. The <hi>fourth Ast</hi> here followeth, deſcribing the joyfull <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> or change of all the Churches afflictions in the day of judgement, the forme where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is figured out in two parables, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Harveſt</hi> and <hi>Vintage,</hi> in the reſt of this Chapter.</p>

                           </gap>nterpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters about the laſt judgement.</note> I ſee all interpreters (a few onely excepted) unanimouſly to agree that the <hi>laſt judgement</hi> is here treated of: And I wonder that any ſhould diſſent in a matter ſo cleare and evident. For by types and words not much unlike, the judgement to come is deſcribed in Dan. 7. touching <hi>the Sonne of man comming in the clondes of heaven to judgement:</hi> and Mat. 3. &amp; 13. of <hi>the harveſt of the tares and wheat.</hi> They agree alſo in the ſcope, that theſe types ſerve to comfort the godly, and terrifie the wicked. For the godly doe groane under their afflictions &amp; trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, deſiring to know what end at length ſhall be put to their evils: On the contrary Tyrants and Antichriſt doe-tumultuouſly rage without let or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, promiſing to themſelves perpetuall proſperity: Leſt therefore the faithfull ſhould be diſcouraged, ſeeing the ſonne of perdition thus to rage, and themſelves overwhelmed with divers ſorrows and calamities, here the laſt judgement is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to <hi>John,</hi> in which ſhall follow a wonderfull change of things. For then the <hi>Wheat</hi> ſhall be gathered into the heavenly Barne, and the <hi>chaffe</hi> burned with unquenchable fire. This I ſay is the ſcope and uſe of the remaining matter in the Chapter.</p>
                     <p>But in the coherence of theſe things with the foregoing, I finde all equally at a
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:96676:204"/>ſtay, as not perceiving wherefore the laſt judgement is here againe repreſented,
<note place="margin">Touching the Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters are troubled.</note> ſeing it was before ſhewed unto <hi>John,</hi> Chap. 6. towards the end. &amp; Chap. 11. to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end. and afterward againe in Chap. 16. and moſt clearely in the end of Chapters 19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20. <hi>Ribera</hi> (as before Chap. 11) hath nothing to ſay, ſave that the day of judgement is here deſcribed by an anticipation: becauſe the context of the things themſelves requires that the puniſhment of the wicked be here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. But no reaſon can be given why theſe judgements ſhould be ſo often deſcribed, and that indeed at the end of every <hi>Viſion,</hi> except our method be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, in which we have noted that all the generall viſions conſiſt of <hi>foure Acts</hi> anſwering each to other. This therefore is the true cauſe why the laſt judgement is here againe repreſented, becauſe the <hi>last Act</hi> of the <hi>fourth Viſion</hi> now follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Let us ſee the words.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And I ſaw</hi>] This is the laſt part of the viſion.
<note place="margin">The laſt Iugdement figured out by the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt and Vintage.</note> The day of judgement is figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out by two types, The <hi>Harveſt</hi> and <hi>Vintage:</hi> becauſe there ſhall be two acts of the ſame: The gathering of the godly into heaven, and the caſting of the wicked into hell fire. <hi>The former</hi> is ſet forth by the <hi>Harvest,</hi> in which the <hi>wheat ſhall be gathered into the barne,</hi> according to the parable of Chriſt, Mat. 13.30. <hi>The latter,</hi> by the <hi>Vintage,</hi> becauſe the wicked ſhall be troaden downe in the lake of Gods wrath, that is, be tormented with eternall paines of hell. So theſe types may not unfitly be diſtinguiſhed.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding it is not amiſſe to difference them as the <hi>whole</hi> and <hi>part.</hi> For the <hi>Harveſt</hi> ſhall not onely gather the <hi>wheat out of the Lords field into the garner,</hi> but alſo burne the tares that are gathered, as we ſee in the ſaid parable, Mat. 13. Thus the <hi>Harveſt</hi> ſhould repreſent the whole judgement. But the <hi>vintage</hi> ſhall caſt and tread all the grapes in the lake of Gods wrath. Now the godly ſhall not be caſt into this lake, <hi>for they ſhall not come into condemnation,</hi> Ioh. 5.24. But the ungodly onely. And therefore by the <hi>vintage</hi> the puniſhment of the wicked ſeemes onely to be repreſented. Thus much of the parables in generall.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And behold a white cloud</hi>] The perſon of Chriſt the Iudge is gloriouſly diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in this verſe, by foure adjuncts. 1. <hi>by his forme:</hi> that he <hi>is like to the Son of man.</hi> 2. <hi>by the geſture of body,</hi> he ſits on <hi>a white cloud:</hi> 3. <hi>by his habit,</hi> he hath on <hi>his head a Crown of Gold.</hi> 4. <hi>By the Inſtrument:</hi> He holds in his hand a ſharpe <hi>Sicle.</hi> In theſe words is no obſcurity: therefore I will not dwell on them.</p>
                     <p>They who deny or doubt, (as <hi>Ribera</hi> and <hi>Brightman</hi>) that the <hi>Son of man</hi> doth here denote Chriſt, becauſe it is not ſaid the <hi>Son of man,</hi> but <hi>like to the Son of man:</hi> Neither with an article <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſeeme in my opinion to ground it on a very ſlight conjecture. For in Dan. 7.13. It is plain; Chriſt is ſaid to be like to the Son of man: <hi>I ſaw in the clouds of Heaven as it were the Son of man.</hi> And Paul Philip 2.7. <hi>Being made in the likeneſſe of men, he was found in faſhion or habit as a man.</hi> And Rom. 8. <hi>He ſent his ſon in the likeneſſe of ſinfull fleſh.</hi> And Heb. 2.14. <hi>He likewiſe tooke part of fleſh and blood:</hi> and Verſe 17. <hi>It behoved him to bee made like his brethren:</hi> In which Phraſes the verity of Chriſts humane nature is not denyed, but the priviledge of the <hi>Man-Chriſt</hi> is noted: that though he bee like unto us in all things, yet is he not (like us) man onely, but God alſo; neither as man is he borne a ſinner of mans ſeed, but conceived and begotten of a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin by the operation of the Holy Ghoſt, being not defiled with any ſtaine of ſinne.</p>
                     <p>That which they ſay of the <hi>Article,</hi> is infirme: For before alſo in Chap. 1.13. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw CHRIST <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> 
                        <hi>like to the Son of man</hi> (without an Article) <hi>ſtanding in the middeſt of the ſeven Candleſtickes:</hi> Here he ſees him ſitting as a Iudge on his Tribunall.</p>
                     <p>

                        <hi>On a white cloud</hi>] Noting his divine Majeſty: For God in the Pſalms is often ſaid to be carried and ride on the clouds, becauſe of his heavenly power. This <hi>white cloud</hi> is that throne of glory, whereon Chriſt ſaith he will ſit, Mat. 25.31. The which throne he himſelfe interprets of the clouds of heaven, Mat. 26.64. <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after yee ſhall ſee the Sonne of man ſitting on the right hand of power, and comming in the clouds of heaven,</hi> according to that in Dan. 7.13.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The crown of gold on his head,</hi> is the enſigne of his Kingly Majeſty. In Chap. 19.12. he hath many Diadems on his head: and on his thigh a name written, <hi>The King of kings, and Lord of lords.</hi> The <hi>Beaſt</hi> alſo had <hi>crownes</hi> on his <hi>hornes,</hi> but not of gold, and <hi>ten</hi> onely. This Iudge therefore is more powerfull then Antichriſt and all tyrants, for with an <hi>iron rod</hi> he will cruſh all adverſaries as a potters veſſell in the day of judgement.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The ſharp ſickle of a reaper,</hi> which is in his hand, to wit, in his <hi>right hand,</hi> denotes Chriſts judicary and divine power, to whom it is as eaſle to execute his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the whole earth, as for reapers with a ſharp ſickle to cut down the ripe corne. ANDREAS: <hi>the ſickle,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is a ſymbole of conſummation,</hi> for Chriſt himſelf cals the end of the world, a harveſt, Mat. 13.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. <hi>Another Angell came out of the temple</hi>] This Angell and the other two comming forth out of the temple and altar, verſ. 17.18. are not preachers of the Goſpell, as <hi>Brightman</hi> ſuppoſeth (for at the harveſt and vintage of the laſt judgement preaching ſhall ceaſe) but it is one of the chiefe Miniſters of Chriſt, by whom he will execute the judgement. He comes out of the <hi>Temple,</hi> to wit, of heaven, as verſ. 17. &amp; before Chap. 11.19. By and by another comes forth from the Altar of Heaven, which is viſionally to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: becauſe properly there is no Temple nor Altar in heaven: but formerly in Ieruſalem it was faſhioned and made according to the heavenly patterne. <hi>The great cry of the Angell</hi> (ſaith ANDREAS) denotes <hi>the common ſupplication of all vertues, deſiring to ſee the glory indeed of the juſt, but the exciſion of the unjuſt and all iniquity, that tranſitory and unſtable things might have an end, and that which is ſtable and eternal appeare.</hi>

                        <hi>Thruſt thy ſickle</hi>] It is no commanding but a ſupplicating voice, for the Angels command not Chriſt, but worſhip him: The words are taken out of <hi>Joel</hi> 3.13. where Iehovah ſaith: <hi>I will ſit in the valley of Jehoſaphat to judge all the heathen round about. Put yee in the ſickle, for the harveſt is ripe.</hi> The Angell knew that the day of judgement was neare, and intreateth therefore, that the judge would ſtay no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but thruſt the ſickle into the harveſt.</p>

                        <hi>To reap</hi>] That is, to take away men from the earth: by gathering the good as wheat into the barne: but the tares into bundles to be burnt, as is declared, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.30.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For the harvest is ripe</hi>] This is the ſecond reaſon, from the next cauſe, or order of nature, requiring harveſt when the corne is white, Ioh. 4.35. <hi>Lift up your eyes, ſaith Chriſt, and looke on the fields, for they are already white to harveſt:</hi> Therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ripe, the time of harveſt is at hand. This <hi>ripeneſſe</hi> ſignifies that the meaſure of the Churches calamities, Antichriſts tyranny, and the iniquity of the wicked was now full, as God in <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.21. ſaith touching the ſinnes of the <hi>Sodomites:</hi> that he was come to ſee whither they were come to the full height or not: And Chriſt of the Phariſees: Mat. 23.32. <hi>Fill yee up then the meaſure of your fathers.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.9. Rom. 2.4.</note> This alſo commendeth both the patience and juſtice of God: <hi>The Lord is not ſlack in his judgement, but is patient towards us, not willing that any ſhould periſh: but by long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering leadeth us to repentance.</hi> So then he will execute judgement moſt juſtly, becauſe he will not doe it, till there be no hope of the worlds recovery, and that the ſinnes of men are come to that height as none ſhall have cauſe to complaine either of the overmuch haſte or ſeverity of the Iudge.</p>
                     <p n="16">16 <hi>And he that ſate on the cloude thruſt in his ſickle</hi>] Chriſt readily yeelds to the requeſt of the Saints: for its no ſooner deſired, but he <hi>thruſts the ſickle into the earth,</hi> for, <hi>into the ripe fruits of the earth,</hi> by a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> that is, on men themſelves. When therefore the houre of judgement ſhall come, Chriſt will finiſh the harveſt of the earth, without any delay, labour, or hinderance, for he is a moſt carefull and powerfull Iudge.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And the earth was reaped</hi>] that is, both the living and the dead being cited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the tribunall ſeat of judgement received rewards, according to that in <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.29. <hi>&amp; Mat.</hi> 25.46.</p>
                     <p>The declaration of this parabolicall harveſt is beſt expounded by Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, Mat. 13.39. <hi>The harveſt is the end of the world: The reapers are the Angels: then the Sonne of man ſhall ſend forth, and ſay, gather yee together firſt the tares, and binde them in bundles to burne them: but gather the wheat into my barne. The tares are the ſeed of the wicked one: the good ſeed are the children of the Kingdome. Then therefore the Angels ſhall gather out of his kingdome all things that offend, and them which doe ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and ſhall caſt them into a furnace of fire, there ſhall be wailing and gnaſhing of teeth: but the righteous ſhall ſhine forth as the Sun in the Kingdome of their Father, &amp;c.</hi> This is that harveſt which <hi>John</hi> ſaw, by us indeed who walke in faith, longed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but it ſhall be dreadfull unto the <hi>worſhippers of the Beaſt:</hi> for we ſhall be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered into <hi>Gods barne:</hi> but as many as have not repented of their Antichriſtian idolatry, being threſhed with the eternall ſcourges of Gods wrath, ſhall be burnt in hell fire.</p>
                     <p>If thou demaund how Chriſt himſelf is ſaid to thruſt the ſickle into the earth: ſeeing this charge was committed before to the <hi>reaping Angels:</hi> we have even now anſwered, that Chriſt is ſaid to have done that which the Angels are to doe by his commandement, as in Ioh. 4.2. <hi>Chriſt is ſaid to have made and baptized more Diſciples then John,</hi> yet it is added, <hi>he baptized not, but his Diſciples did,</hi> to wit, by his authority and commandement.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. <hi>And another Angell came out of the Temple</hi>] Another type of the foreſaid judgement, properly repreſenting the horrible puniſhments of the wickedunder the forme of a vintage. <hi>Firſt</hi> Chriſt doth againe come forth in the likeneſſe of an Angell with a ſharpe ſickle not to reap, (as before) but to cut downe the vine, which again repreſents Chriſts judicatory power.</p>
                     <p>Some by this Angell underſtand the Saints, who in that great Day, as aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants to Chriſt, ſhall judge the world, according to that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. But I dare not attribute this ſickle to the Saints. Perhaps this Angell is one of the chiefe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:96676:206"/>of Chriſt the Iudge: Or it is an <hi>Enallage</hi> of the ſingular for the plurall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as the Angells ſhall be Reapers, ſo alſo Vintagers in the end of the world. Yet I ſee nothing to hinder, why Chriſt the Iudge may not here be underſtood, who alone holdeth the <hi>Iudicatory Sickle,</hi> becauſe he onely hath received all power from the Father. For often Chriſt is ſaid to be an Angell: as in Chap. 7.2. &amp; 8.3. &amp; 10.1. To wit, the <hi>Angell of the Covenant,</hi> and great Counſell: neither is it unuſuall that Chriſt in reſpect of his divers functions in divers Viſions, ſhould alſo be repreſented under divers Types, as ſometimes being called the <hi>Son of man,</hi> otherwhile a <hi>Lambe, a Lyon, an Angell, &amp;c.</hi> He is ſaid <hi>to come out of the Temple,</hi> the which Iohn in Chap. 11.19. ſaw <hi>open in Heaven:</hi> for the <hi>Temple,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>Sanctuary:</hi> was a figure of Heaven: Heb. 9.2. ſo then he came out of Heaven from whence the Iudge ſhall come.</p>
                     <p>We ſee that all things are <hi>dramatically</hi> acted in this Revelation: for as in <hi>Comoedies</hi> among men, divers perſons comming out of divers <hi>Scenes,</hi> do act their parts on the Theatre: ſo it is in theſe Viſions, to the end we might more eaſily perceive Heavenly things by a certain ſimilitude of things done amongſt us.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. <hi>And another Angell came out from the Altar</hi>] Seeing the former Angell having the <hi>Sickle,</hi> was Chriſt the Iudge: We therefore do rightly underſtand this Angell to be ſome chiefe Miniſter of Chriſt: whoſe Cry; <hi>Thrust thy Sickle,</hi> is not a commanding voyce or admonitory, as if the Iudge were ſlack in his Office, but ſupplicatory, deſiring him not to deferre the Iudgement any longer, but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute the ſame, becauſe of the inveterate malice of the world: as in verſe 15.</p>
                     <p>He comes out <hi>of the Altar</hi>] Or <hi>from the Altar,</hi> that is, from Chriſt who is the Heavenly Altar: namely as a <hi>Herauld,</hi> who in the name of all the reſt proclaimes the time of the laſt Iudgement, teſtifies the deſire of all the Heavenly Powers, for the vindication of the Church, and puniſhment of the adverſaries, and offers as it were his moſt ready miniſtery to the Iudge.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Having power over fire] Hence we learne,</hi> ſaith <hi>Andreas, that God hath ſet the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall powers as administrators of things created by him: One over Water, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther over Fire,

Yet I neither will affirme, nor deny whether ſome are ſet over one Element, others over another: becauſe afterward in Chap. 16.5.
<note place="margin">What is meant by this fire.</note> mention is made of the <hi>Angell of the waters:</hi> Nevertheleſſe it is clear, God uſeth them to execute ſome one judgement, ſome another.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore what this <hi>Fire</hi> is, over which he is ſaid to have power, is diverſly diſputed: <hi>ſome</hi> underſtand the <hi>fire of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> But no created Angell can have power over the holy Ghoſt, who is the eternall God. <hi>Others,</hi> the fire, which ſhall conſume the world: as if this Angell who is ſaid to have power over <hi>fire,</hi> ſhould ſet the whole world on fire. But God ſhall need no Incendiaties to burne the World.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ribera</hi> hereby underſtands the <hi>fire of the heavenly Altar,</hi> by which the Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Saints were burn'd: probably indeed, but by an allegory not ſafe enough: for ſeeing the ſacrifices of the Saints in Heaven are their prayers and thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, by which they allwayes praiſe the Lord: I ſee not how it agrees to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian beleife, that any created Angell ſhould have power over this fire. But I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that none have applyed it to the <hi>fire of Purgatory.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bede</hi> applyes it to the fire of <hi>Puniſhment:</hi> which <hi>Ribera</hi> approves not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the puniſhment of the wicked is here Metaphorically figured, not by <hi>fire,</hi> but by the <hi>Wine-Preſſe of Gods wrath:</hi> yet a little before we heard that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly ſhould be tormented <hi>with fire and brimstone,</hi> the <hi>ſmoake whereof ſhould aſcend up for ever and ever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This interpretation <hi>Bullinger</hi> followeth, and we alſo approve of: for fire in the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> and generally through the whole Scripture, denotes Gods plagues and puniſhment on the wicked, the which he executeth by his Angells.</p>

This <hi>Angell</hi> therefore hath power, to wit, miniſterially over <hi>Hell fire,</hi> becauſe by this Angell, or by theſe Angells (for it may be an <hi>Enallage</hi> of the ſingular for the plurall) Chriſt the Iudge will caſt the <hi>tares</hi> into eternall fire: which agrees with the Parable of Chriſt.

                        <hi>And gather the Cluſters of the Vine of the earth</hi>] A Vine doth ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note the Church: Iſa 5.1. Mat. 20.1. Into which the Lord ſends divers labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers to dreſſe the ſame. But here it ſignifies other the <hi>Church of malignants,</hi> or the world of ungodly men: therefore he calls it <hi>the Vine of the earth,</hi> for, the whole multitude of the wicked, who are not thoſe ripe grapes, which the Lord looked for and found not in his Vineyard: Iſa 5.2. but it is taken in the evill part for the wild, unripe and ſowre grapes, which God in wrath threatens to cut off: And they are ſaid to be <hi>ripe,</hi> not for <hi>new Wine,</hi> but Verjuyce: becauſe when the wickedneſſe of the ungodly is grown to its full ripeneſſe, deſtruction &amp; ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine neceſſarily followes.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. <hi>And the Angell thruſt in his Sickle</hi>] The execution will be ſhort: for the Iudge, when the houre is come ſhall without any let <hi>cut downe the Vintage of the earth,</hi> that is, execute wrath on the wicked, by caſting them into the great Lake of Gods wrath.

                     <p>Why the holy Ghoſt doth aſſigne preciſely this number to the lake, needs not to be known by us. <hi>Andreas</hi> thinkes it is to <hi>ſignifie the conſummated iniquity of thoſe men, and the greatneſſe of their puniſhment: ſeeing a millinary number is moſt perfect, and most conſummate: And in the ſixe hundred yeer of Noah, we read that ſin was overwhelmed by water.</hi> But it is more ſafe to ſay that a great definite number put for an indefinite.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Lyra <hi>applyes all theſe things Metaphorically unto the Acts of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Popes,</hi> Hadrian, Leo, Hildebrand, &amp;c. <hi>againſt the Emperours</hi> Conſtantine <hi>the</hi> Image Breaker, <hi>and</hi> Henry IV. <hi>and others, untill the</hi> Holy Warre <hi>raiſed by</hi> Peter <hi>the Hermite, that is, from the yeere</hi> 742. <hi>untill the yeer</hi> 1094: <hi>But his grounds are inſufficient, for if ſo, then theſe plagues should have been ended long agoe, whereas they are called the</hi> laſt, <hi>filling up the wrath of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ribera <hi>applying it litterally to the foure yeers of Antichriſt, ſuppoſeth, that there shall be reall plagues like the Egyptian, unto which there is here a plain alluſion; But it will manifeſtly appeare in its place, that the litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſenſe cannot generally ſtand: Yea even hence it appeares, that the Kingdome of</hi> Antichriſt <hi>is abſurdly ſtraitned to the time of foure yeers: becauſe the Hiſtory of the ſeven plagues requires a far greater time. We will collect from ſuch things as are plaine the darke and obſcurer matters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two things ſeem to be cleer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, that the beginning of theſe plagues belong to the time when the beaſt was allready aſcended out of the ſea and earth, and when the whole world worshipped his image: Yea, when the beaſt began to be overcome by ſome, that is, after Popery had ſtood a long while in its flourishing eſtate, and began now again ſomewhat to decline: This appears by the</hi> firſt <hi>and</hi> fift Viall <hi>poured out upon the worshippers &amp; throne of the beaſt.</hi> Chap. 16. ver. 2.10. <hi>as alſo by the ſong for the victory over the beaſt.</hi> Chap. 16.2.</p>
               <p>The Second is, <hi>that the plagues shall end in the fall of</hi> Babylon, <hi>when the Iſlands shall flee away, and the mountaines shall not be found, that is, in the end of the world: which appears by the</hi> ſeventh Vial: <hi>ſee alſo Chap.</hi> 20.11.
<note place="margin">The fift viſion is not univerſall.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By which,</hi> firſt <hi>it is manifeſt, that this Viſion is not univerſall, neither doth it contain the whole Hiſtory of the Church, as did the three foregoing, but is particular and reſtrained to Antichriſts Kingdom: Therefore it doth
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:96676:208"/>not conſiſt of the four Acts, which we shewed were in the former: but onely of the two latter: ſo that the</hi> ſeven Vials <hi>anſwer not to the</hi> ſeven Seales <hi>and Trumpets, as ſome have thought, becauſe of their likeneſſe in ſome effects: for the beginning of the</hi> Seales <hi>and</hi> Trumpets <hi>extended it ſelfe even to the times of the Apoſtles, and firſt birth, (ſo to ſay) of the Chriſtian Church as before appeared: whereas the pouring out of the Vials only shadowes out the laſt plagues of the Kingdom of the beaſt.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>It is manifeſt that this</hi> Viſion <hi>belongs to the laſt times, and shall be finished indeed at the end of the world, but takes its beginning about the time that the meaſuring of the Temple (treated of in</hi> Chap. 11.) <hi>was already begun, that is, about the time of the Churches Reformation in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and maners, whereby the throne of the beaſt was grievouſly shaken, and the Popes Kingdom much weakned by</hi> Luther, <hi>and other evangel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall Preachers.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>as the Goſpell shalbe pleaſing and ſaving to the elect: becauſe by it they overcome the beaſt, for which they shall celebrate God with perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all praiſes: ſo to Antichriſtians it shall be grievous and mortall, becauſe being turned into rage in regard of the ſucceſſe thereof, they shall fret and grieve to ſee their kingdom, which ſeemed immoveable, to be weakened, leſſened, and go to ruine, untill (being waſted with the laſt plagues) they shalbe caſt according to the threatning of the third Angell</hi> Chap. 14.10. <hi>into everlaſting tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of fire &amp; brimſtone.

The ſecond, <hi>from the finall fall of Babylon: the Popes paraſites affirm:</hi> that the ſeat of Saint Peter ſhall endure for ever: that the Catholick Romane Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing founded and ſtrengthened by God ſhall ſtand, &amp;c.

                           <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd I ſaw as it were a ſea of glaſſe</hi>] Before the Angells pour out the plagues, <hi>a company of Harpers</hi> come forth on the Theatre, celebrating the power &amp; judgement of God. And why ſo? <hi>to prevent</hi> the thoughts of the godly, leſt they might think that the following plagues were repugnant to the goodneſſe and juſtice of God: and the blaſphemies of the wicked, that they might not accuſe God of cruelty, and complaine of injury done unto them.</p>
                     <p>It ſerves alſo to the decency of the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iſion:</hi> for as in <hi>Commoedies</hi> muſicall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terludes are againe and againe iterated at the ending of their Acts, to delight the beholders and drive away tediouſneſſe: ſo in this apparitionall Revelation are heard almoſt in every Viſion, a company of ſingers, as it were in diſtinct Acts: leaſt either Iohn in the contemplation of ſo long a Revelation, or we in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating thereon, ſhould be over wearied.</p>
                     <p>We have heard the ſcope of this apparition. Now let us ſee who theſe <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> are, where they were, how, and what they ſang. Firſt the place is noted: <hi>A Sea of glaſſe mingled with Fire:</hi> the meaning whereof we ſhall the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, when we know, what this company of ſingers is.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I ſaw them that had gotten the victory</hi>] If they got the <hi>victory over the Beast,</hi> then the <hi>beaſt</hi> had fought with them,
<note place="margin">Who theſe harpers are.</note> to wit the ſame who made war with the Saints Chap. 13. verſe 7. Theſe <hi>Harpers</hi> therefore are thoſe Saints there mentioned. The ſucceſſe of the war is not proſperous to the <hi>Beast,</hi> he ſought to devour them: but on the contrary he himſelfe was vanquiſhed, though indeed it was a bloody victory to the Saints. This divine miracle ought to animate the godly cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to fight againſt the <hi>Beaſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But how do the Saints overcome the <hi>Beast:</hi> ſeeing in Chap. 13.15. the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond beast cauſed all that would not worſhip the firſt to be ſlaine?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">How they overcame the beaſt.</note> how then do they conquer, ſeing they are ſlaine?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I anſwer:</hi> the victory of the Saints is ſpirituall: They are indeed bodily o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome and ſlain by the Beaſt, ſuffering puniſhments and torments this way: yet ſpiritually they overcome the beaſt, while by refuting and condemning his falſe and idolatrous worſhip, they conſtantly perſiſt both in life and death in the true faith of Chriſt: This is the victory of the holy Martyrs and Confeſſours, of which it is ſaid:
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.4</note> 
                        <hi>The victory that overcometh the world is our faith.</hi> It is bloody in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and not obtained without great reſiſtance, yet it ſo far excelleth all the triumphs of <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> by how much the <hi>Beaſt</hi> is more cruell then thoſe Monarchs. They by force of armes brought ſome part of the world under their power: But to this <hi>Beaſt</hi> the <hi>Dragon</hi> gave great power, ſo as the whole world followed and wondred after the ſame.</p>
                     <p>This victory of the Saints <hi>John</hi> makes as it were fourfold.
<note place="margin">The victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Saints fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">I. They got the victory <hi>over the beaſt</hi>] that is, over Antichriſt himſelfe, whoſe power, threatning, and Tyranny they deſpiſed and contemned, cleaving con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly unto Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. <hi>Over his Image</hi>] to wit, which he cauſed to be made for him <hi>by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the earth.</hi> This we have ſhewed to be that whole <hi>Idol worſhip,</hi> by which the <hi>worſhippers of the Beaſt</hi> rage againſtall, who refuſe to adore him and his Image: Now to contemne this ſo great a madneſſe, and overcome it by their blood, is to <hi>get the victory over the Image of the beaſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">III. <hi>Over his character</hi>] viz. which the ſecond <hi>beast</hi> cauſed to be imprinted in the <hi>right hand</hi> or <hi>foreheads</hi> of the worſhippers of the <hi>firſt beaſt.</hi> Chap. 13. verſe 16. This we ſhewed to be both a common and ſpeciall obligation to the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and worſhip of Antichriſt. Over this <hi>Character</hi> the Saints and Profeſſours
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:96676:210"/>get the victory when they caſt off the <hi>beaſts religion,</hi> and conſtantly refuſe to be obedient unto him.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. <hi>Over the number of his name</hi>] which in Chap. 13. verſ. 8. he ſhewed was 666. being Antichriſts nationall name expreſſed in the Hebrew letters of <hi>ROMAN<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> and the Greek <hi>LATEINOS,</hi> as before we ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Over this number and name alſo the Saints get the victory, by communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating no more in the <hi>Romiſh Idolatry, Latine ſervice, Maſſes,</hi> &amp;c. This is the victory for which the <hi>company of harpers</hi> ſing ſongs of Prayſes to God.
<note place="margin">Whether theſe har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers are the Martyrs or other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>But are theſe <hi>harpers</hi> the Martyrs in Heaven, or the faithfull in the Church Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant?

                     <p>For my part I underſtand it ſimply to be the ſame company of <hi>harpers,</hi> who in the foregoing Viſion Chap. 14. ver. 3. by a new ſong did gratulate the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>ſealed ones, ſtanding with the Lambe on Mount Sion.</hi> Nevertheleſſe <hi>Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> opinon is not altogether to be rejected, becauſe the word <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>who overcome,</hi> is in the preſent tenſe: for if the triumphant Church were onely meant: hee would have ſaid in the preterperfect <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Furthermore from this place there ariſeth unto us a moſt ſweet conſolation, touching the ſpirituall <hi>victory we obtaine over the beast</hi> by the ſincerity and conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of our faith, although the <hi>Beaſt</hi> bite, kicke, perſecute and kill us: It ſerves alſo to ſtir us up ſtoutly to reſiſt him. Beſides it furniſheth us with three things, for the true underſtanding of the <hi>foregoing</hi> matter.
<note place="margin">The Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beaſt is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> that the former <hi>beast aſcending out of the Sea,</hi> could not be the <hi>old Romane Empire,</hi> but neceſſarily Antichriſt: The reaſon is, becauſe theſe <hi>holy harpers,</hi> ſing not a triumphant ſong for any conqueſt they had over <hi>the Romane Empire,</hi> ſeeing they never made war againſt it: for Chriſtians according to the precept of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle were allwayes obedient to Emperours:
<note place="margin">The Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beaſt and that riſing out of the earth is the ſame Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</note> but they celebrate the victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Antichriſt, with his ſinfull deceits and inventions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> that the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond beast</hi> in a divers reſpect, denotes one and the ſame Antichriſt, as before we have declared: <hi>The reaſon is,</hi> becauſe one, that is the former is onely mentioned, who being overcome the latter was ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: Now the Saints rejoyced and ſung becauſe Antichriſt was overcome.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Antichriſts Kingdome cannot bee ſtraitned to four years.</note> that Antichriſts Kingdom cannot poſſible be reſtrained to the ſpace of foure yeers, as the Papiſts will have it: <hi>The reaſon is</hi> becauſe many Martyrs and Profeſſours had already gotten the victory over Antichriſt, before the Plagues were poured out upon the <hi>throne and worſhippers of the beaſt.</hi> Now all the plagues cannot be comprehended within ſo ſhort a ſpace, but muſt longer torment the followers of Antichriſt, as we ſhall ſee hereafter. Therefore it neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, that Antichriſt bare ſway and made war with the Saints long before thoſe foure yeers, foraſmuch as here it is ſaid he was overcome by them. Thus much touching the perſons of the <hi>Harpers:</hi> now let us ſee where they were.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I ſaw as it were a ſea of glaſſe] Lyra</hi> (whom <hi>Gagnaeus</hi> followeth) makes this <hi>ſea</hi> the <hi>Sacrament of Baptiſme:</hi> which is <hi>glaſſe,</hi> that is, pure: <hi>mingled with fire,</hi> that is, with the regenetating <hi>grace</hi> of the holy Ghoſt. <hi>Andreas</hi> will have it to be meant of the multitude of them that ſhall be ſaved, in which ſence the <hi>ſea</hi> and <hi>harpers</hi> ſhould be the ſame: which is not proper. <hi>Lambertus,</hi> of the large knowledge of the truth: <hi>Brightman,</hi> the doctrine of the Goſpell, ſaid to be <hi>glaſſe,</hi> that is, perſpicuous and clear: but <hi>mingled with Fire,</hi> to wit, of contentions and ſtrifes
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:96676:211"/>which Satan hath raiſed amongſt the teachers of the Goſpell. But theſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I paſſe by.</p>
                     <p>Before in Chap. 4. verſe 6. <hi>John ſaw before the throne, a ſea of glaſſe like to chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall,</hi> which is the pureſt glaſſe. Now here he ſees the ſame <hi>ſea:</hi> It denotes the world of wicked men. <hi>Ribera</hi> rightly calls it the multitude following Antichriſt, for the <hi>ſea</hi> is called a gathering of waters: The <hi>waters</hi> are the wicked nations o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying Antichriſt, as in Chap. 17. And Ierem. 51.42. <hi>Cyrus</hi> Army that van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed <hi>Babylon</hi> is called, <hi>a ſea comming up upon her and covering her with the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the waves thereof.</hi> The <hi>ſea</hi> therefore is a gathering of people, or the whole multitude of the ungodly, that is, the world toſſed like the Sea with many waves and confuſions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is of glaſſe,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Why the ſea is ſaid to be glaſſe.</note> ſo ſaid, firſt becauſe it is clear as glaſſe, that is perſpicuous and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the eyes of God: for God ſees the ſecret counſells and hidden endeavours of the world and Antichriſt: <hi>ſecondly,</hi> becauſe it is bright like Chryſtall: for the pompe and luſtre of the world bewitcheth Antichriſtians. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> becauſe its weak and brickle as glaſſe: for the world paſſeth away with the luſt thereof. The favour and proſperity of the world is <hi>glaſſie,</hi> for when it moſt ſhineth it is then broken. <hi>Lastly,</hi> The ſea for the moſt part is like <hi>glaſſe</hi> in colour: hence the Poets call the Sea <hi>Mare vitreum, undas vitreas,</hi> the glaſſie Sea and glaſſie waves. <hi>It is mingled with fire,</hi> viz. of afflictions and calamities, in which the godly alſo are often involved: however they ſtand as conquerours <hi>upon this ſea,</hi> becauſe they trample the world with the delights and baites thereof under feet: neither are they of the world, nor removed from their ſtation by the fire of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, but perſiſt conſtantly in the faith unto the end. This indeed the Saints triumphant have fully attained unto, and we, who are yet in the body in part: for it is our duty alſo <hi>to ſtand on the ſea,</hi> that is, to trample the world under our feet. Or they ſtand <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <hi>nigh or beſides the ſea</hi>] becauſe they are not part of <hi>the ſea</hi> or world, but ſeparated and redeemed from the world, as in Chap. 14. ver. 4. And this ſenſe I like beſt: becauſe by the following verſe it appears, here is an alluſion to the <hi>red ſea,</hi> by which the Iſraelites ſtanding, ſaw the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans drowned, and rejoicing over their deſtruction, ſang ſongs of praiſes to God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Having the harps of God</hi>] By an hebraiſme <hi>the harps of God</hi> are put for ſuch as are rare and of a moſt ſweet ſound:
<note place="margin">The harps of God.</note> for with the Hebrews whatſoever are ſaid to be the things <hi>of God,</hi> are excelling things, worthy his high Majeſty: ſo the <hi>mountaines of God, the Caedars of God, the City of God,</hi> that is, very high and great. It is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the <hi>harpes of David</hi> and of other Saints, by which they ſometimes prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God. Theſe are infinitely ſweeter in ſound: for theſe <hi>harpers</hi> ſang <hi>a new ſong which none could learne but they that were marked with the ſeale of God:</hi> unknown alſo to the former Saints, <hi>viz.</hi> touching the weakning and ruine of Antichriſts kingdome by theſe <hi>harpes,</hi> that is, by the preaching, Prayers, and ſweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of theſe Champions.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>And they ſing</hi>] for, <hi>they ſang,</hi> viz. with their harpes, together with their voyces, like to joyfull harpers. But what ſing they? <hi>The ſong of Moſes the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God</hi>] We have a twofold <hi>ſong of Moſes:</hi> One of <hi>thanksgiving</hi> which he ſang with the Iſraelites by the <hi>red ſea,</hi> for the overthrow of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians: <hi>I will ſing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriouſſy, the horſe and his rider hath he thrown into the ſea:</hi> Exodus 15.1. The other of praiſes, celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Gods wonderfull benefits unto the Iſraelites, Deut. 32. Both may bee here underſtood, but cheifly the former, becauſe of the ſimilitude: for as then the Iſraelites ſtanding by the <hi>red ſea, ſang</hi> with <hi>Moſes</hi> their leader a triumphant <hi>ſong</hi> unto God for the drowning their adverſaries, under whoſe bondage they had a long time <hi>groaned:</hi> ſo the ſaints being brought thorow the vaſt ſea of this world, do joyntly <hi>ſing</hi> praiſes to God, and bleſſe him for their deliverance from the moſt cruell bondage of Antichriſt. And hereby they intimate not obſcurely that
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:96676:211"/>
                        <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the Egyptian ſervitude was a figure of the Churches bondage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Antichriſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And the ſong of the Lambe</hi>] that is, praiſing the Lambe for his benefits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on the Church.</p>
                     <p>Divers ſongs we have already heard. In Chap. 4.11.
<note place="margin">The ſongs of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</note> The elders ſing to him that ſate on the throne: <hi>Thou art worthy O Lord to receive glory.</hi> Chap. 5.9. The Elders againe ſing a new <hi>ſong to the Lambe: Thou art worthy to take the Booke and to open the ſeales thereof: for thou waſt ſlaine and haſt redeemed us to God by thy blood, and haſt made us Kings and Prieſts to our God, &amp;c.</hi> Vnto which ſong the Angells and all creatures do there by mutuall accord <hi>ſing Amen.</hi> Chap. 11.17. they likewiſe <hi>ſing</hi> to God: <hi>Wee give thee thankes Lord God Almighty, &amp;c.</hi> A like ſong wee heard Chapter 2. ver. 10. <hi>Now is come ſalvation and ſtrength, and the Kingdom of our God, &amp;c.</hi> Againe in Chap. 14. the company of <hi>harpers</hi> ſang a new ſong to the Lambe ſtanding on Mount Sion. This therefore is the <hi>ſong of the Lamb,</hi> by which the triumphant Church, or the heavenly companies celebrate the Lambes victory, and their own over Antichriſt.

                        </note> conſidering that to him this wonderfull worke of the conqueſt over the beaſt is attributed by the Saints. But now let us hear the ſong.</p>
                     <p>It ſeemes to be collected out of divers places of the Pſalmes and Prophets, by which theſe divine ſingers commend unto us the authority and dignity of the Scriptures. As from Pſal. 86.10. they publiſh the <hi>great and wonderfull workes of God. Great,</hi> becauſe they fill heaven and earth: <hi>Wonderfull,</hi> becauſe they are unſearchable and beyond humane reaſon: ſuch are the works of creation, and the government of the world, our redemption, and preſervation of the Church in this life. from Pſal. 25.10. they celebrate the <hi>true &amp; righteous wayes of the Lord: for all his paths are mercy and truth.

Or rather out of the everlaſting Goſpell Rev. 14. ver. 7. where the firſt Angell cryed: <hi>Fear God, and glorifie his Name:</hi> They ſhew the madneſſe of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian adverſaries, who lift up their hornes againſt Almighty God and the Lambe; and the ſtupidity of the world, which is not moved by the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the great and wonderfull workes of God to feare and glorifie him. <hi>To feare God</hi> is in true faith and obedience to ſubmit to God. <hi>To glorifie God,</hi> is not to make him glorious, as if he were not ſo before, but to celebrate his due glory and praiſe <hi>Onely holy</hi>] They condemne the pride of Antichriſt, boaſting himſelf to be <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>holineſſe:</hi> whereas God alone is holy and holineſſe it ſelfe, purifying the heart, and <hi>ſanctifying</hi> the elect. <hi>For all nations ſhall come</hi>] As in Pſal. 86.9. <hi>All Nations whom thou haſt made ſhall come and worſhip before thee O Lord, and ſhall
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:96676:212"/>glorifie thy Name:</hi> ſhewing not abſolutely what all ſhall do, but what all ought to do: the Antichriſtian adverſaries ſhall never come: for they will not amend by their plagues, but perſevere in their Idolatry and rage againſt God, as we ſhall ſee in the <hi>fourth and fift Viall.</hi> Nevertheleſſe ſome remnants of the Chriſtian na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall come adoring and worſhipping God ſincerely through Ieſus Chriſt: to wit, the elect in <hi>Italy, Germany, France, England,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The Church therefore celebrates the effect of the Goſpell in the laſt times, that ſhe ſhall not decreaſe amidſt her divers afflictions, but be encreaſed by divers nations: who forſaking Antichriſt (his fraud being diſcovered) ſhall turne to Chriſt. Which effect the Antichriſtians have now a long time ſeen, and we yet daily do: And God grant that our poſterity may ſee the like more and more.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For thy judgements are made manifeſt</hi>] That is, are begun to be manifeſted: for as yet they ſpeake not of the finall judgement, nor generally of Gods ancient judgements, but they celebrate in ſpeciall thoſe wonderfull judgements of his, by which he began in theſe laſt times to weaken Antichriſts kingdom, and bring the Church into the liberty of Chriſt: for it is wonderfull to conſider that the power and authority of Antichriſt, which had ſo long beene formidable to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Emperours, and Kings, as cauſing them like ſo many unreaſonable dogs to caſt down themſelves and licke his feet, and as moſt vile ſlaves to hold the bridle or ſtirrup while he mounted on horſeback, ſhould by the preaching and miniſtery of a few poor and contemptible teachers, be expoſed to the common contempt of men, inſomuch as no man but the Popes ſworne vaſſalls, ſhould any more ſtand in awe of his <hi>anathemaes</hi> and threatnings: Now this worke, theſe <hi>Coelestiall har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi> do worthily pronounce not to be of man, but a wonderfull judgement of God, for the which he ought to be praiſed continually of all creatures.</p>
                     <p>The ſenſe therefore is, that becauſe God in the laſt times by the preaching of the Goſpell hath manifeſted Antichriſt, and by his wonderfull judgement poured contempt upon him, it ſhall come to paſſe, that by degrees one Nation after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall leave him, and be converted to Chriſt: and ſo indeed it ſhall be. Onely let not us by our ſins ſtop this judgement of God, which he hath begun to reveale. Thus much of the Triumphant Song.</p>

                     <p>The plagues of Gods judgements are metaphorically called <hi>the wine of the wrath of God</hi> Chap. 14.10. Wine is drunke out of cups, pots, and vialls.

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ialls</hi> are not wont to be made but of gold or of ſilver.</p>
                     <p>The Epithite of <hi>GOD living for ever and ever</hi> doth amplifie the heavineſſe of his wrath, as if he ſhould ſay, This ſhall be a terrible wrath, becauſe it ſhall endure for ever and ever: Thus he ſignifieth that both temporall and eternall puniſhment doth wait for the wicked.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>And the Temple was filled with ſmoake</hi>] John ſaw moreover two things, which put an end to the preparation: Firſt, <hi>The temple was filled with ſmoak</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the Majeſty and power of God: And <hi>ſecondly no man could enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the temple, untill the ſeven plagues were fullfilled.</hi> Here he manifeſtly alludes to the Hiſtory of the tabernacle,
<note place="margin">Ex. 40.33</note> which in the <hi>dedication</hi> thereof was wholly filled with a cloud of the glory of the Lord, ſo as <hi>Moſes</hi> could not enter into it: And to the hiſtory of the Temple,
<note place="margin">1: <hi>King</hi> 8.10.</note> which likewiſe at the dedication was filled with the cloud of the glory of God, ſo as the Prieſts could not ſtand to miniſter, ſo long as the glory of <hi>Jehovah</hi> filled the houſe.</p>
                     <p>That <hi>cloud</hi> was undoubtedly a ſigne of Gods gratious preſence in the Temple and Tabernacle,
<note place="margin">Whether the cloud be a ſigne of grace or wrath.</note> of his approving the worſhip therein, and his hearing the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers there poured out to God. But this <hi>ſmoake</hi> cannot be any ſuch ſigne, ſeeing here is not treated of the worſhip and prayers of the Saints made in the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Temple: But of the plagues of the wrath of God to be hence poured forth upon the adverſaries. Interpreters therefore are of divers opinions, and much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled about it.</p>
                     <p>Moſt will have it to ſignifie in the <hi>theſis,</hi> that Gods judgements are unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and however they are moſt righteous, yet are they not ſo acknowledged untill they are accompliſhed, becauſe this <hi>ſmoake</hi> hinders the knowledge thereof: the which indeed is true, but too generall.</p>
                     <p>Others confeſſe that the <hi>ſmoake</hi> is a ſigne not of grace, but of the wrath of God, becauſe of the diſparatie between the cloud and ſmoake. But yet they do not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently expound wherefore the wrath of God filled the Temple in Heaven, and who were kept out of the ſame, and how long.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and <hi>Arethas</hi> expound this latter (as <hi>Ribera</hi> ſaith) that no man in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoule ſhall enter into heavenly bleſſedneſſe, untill the <hi>ſeven plagues</hi> are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that is, untill the Day of Iudgement. But what is this to the preſent matter.</p>
                     <p>I acknowledge the alluſion of the Hiſtories, but I gather another ſenſe from the ſcope, <hi>viz,</hi> that the whole ſerves for the terrour of Gods adverſaries.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>ſmoake</hi> therefore is a ſymbole of Gods anger in his Temple,
<note place="margin">The authors opinion:</note> and ready to inflict <hi>ſmoake,</hi> that is, horrible blindneſſe on Antichriſtians, yea even on their quicke-ſighted and moſt acute Doctors and Sophiſters,

<pb n="373" facs="tcp:96676:213"/>wicked Idolatry: and ſo cannot repent, untill the <hi>ſeven plagues</hi> were fullfilled, that is, never.

This ſenſe the events of the <hi>Vialls</hi> and <hi>plagues</hi> in the following Chapter will make good unto us.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>ſmoake</hi> therefore denotes the blindneſſe of Antichriſtians under their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. It comes not out of <hi>the bottomleſſe pit,</hi> but <hi>from the glory and from the power of God,</hi> becauſe it ſhall be inflicted by his moſt righteous and powerfull judgement, according to the threatning of the Apoſtle: 2.

                     <p>The univerſall <hi>No man</hi> I reſtraine to the Antichriſtian adverſaries, who one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhall be kept from entring into the Temple, that is, from the acknowledging of Gods judgements, and from repentance, as will appeare in the following Chapter.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>THeſe ſeven Angells are thought by moſt to be ſuch preachers, whom Chriſt in the laſt times will raiſe up againſt Antichriſt, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their threatning inflict theſe plagues on Antichriſtians. If ſo, then theſe Angells of the fift Viſion, should analogically anſwer to the</hi> two witneſſes <hi>of the</hi> third Viſion, <hi>and to the three angels of the fourth Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: becauſe all theſe are publishers of the Goſpell againſt Antichriſte un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſse perhaps they ſo differ in time, as what at firſt was done by</hi> two, <hi>that is a few, afterwards was done by</hi> three, <hi>that is more: and at laſt by</hi> ſeven, <hi>that is, very many were raiſed up to oppoſe Popery. If we take this ſenſe, then the</hi> golden Vialls <hi>given to the Angels should be that golden and eternall goſpell, which the firſt of the three angels flying through the midſt of heaven evangelized to the inhabitants of the earth, ſaying with a great voyce,</hi> Fear God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chap. 14. ver. 6. <hi>And the pouring out of the vials should be the preaching of the Goſpell, which worketh indeed in the elect the</hi> fear of God, <hi>joy and life,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor</hi> 2.15</note> but to the</hi> marked ones of the Beaſt <hi>it occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſores, diſeaſes and death: as the Apoſtle foretold:</hi> That the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell ſhould be a ſavour of death unto death to them that periſh.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This ſenſe</hi> Ribera <hi>the Ieſuite likes not of, Becauſe it is not the worke of Preachers to inflict plagues, but to foretell and denounce them,
<note place="margin">Riberas opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</note> and to deterre men from their evills.</hi> But theſe Angells <hi>ſaith he,</hi> do not foretell the plagues but inflict them. <hi>Therefore</hi> they are true An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells, by whom the Lord inflicts plagues, with he doth not by the Miniſters of the Goſpell. <hi>But theſe things are not ſolid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For</hi> firſt <hi>theſe Angells are not ſaid to cauſe the plagues, but to poure out the vialls of Gods fury: Therefore properly the plagues were cauſed by the wrath of God. The angels were onely miniſters of the pouring out, which lets not, but that it may metaphorically be underſtood of the
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:96676:215"/>publishing and denouncing of the wrath of God. As God therefore by his miniſters ſaves ſome, and condemnes others: ſo alſo he inflicts theſe plagues by their preaching.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">How farre miniſters of the word are ſaid to cauſe plagues.</note> 
                        <hi>it is not abſurd to ſay that the Preachers of the Word do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict plagues, becauſe they communicate in the worke of God, which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutes by them. Therefore they are ſaid</hi> to beget, <hi>and</hi> to ſave <hi>them that heare them: becauſe in this worke they are</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>What then?
<note place="margin">Who the Angells of the ſeven trumpets &amp; of the ſeven vialls are.</note> 
                        <hi>I ſo judge touching theſe</hi> ſeven Angells of the Vialls, <hi>as of the ſeven Angells of the trumpets. The ſix former might denote prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers: becauſe at the ſounding of their Trumpets, the temporall events there deſcribed did happen. But the</hi> ſeventh <hi>could not: becauſe he openly denounced the laſt judgement as preſent;</hi> Chap. 10.7. <hi>&amp;</hi> Chap. 11.15. <hi>he therefore was that</hi> Archangell, <hi>by whoſe voice and Trumpet the dead shall riſe up at the comming of Chriſt.</hi> 1.

                     <p>
                        <hi>So likewiſe</hi> theſe ſix former <hi>may ſignifie miniſters of the Word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe during their Vialls the</hi> marked ones of the beaſt <hi>shall be ſmitten with theſe plagues in this life: But the</hi> ſeventh <hi>proclaiming the conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>

But there is no neceſſity urging us to affirme, that he preciſely shewed unto him the manner and perſons, that is how, and by whom he would accomplish the ſame.</hi>

                     <p>Now let us ſee what manner of fore this is,
<note place="margin">Lyras opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> 
                        <hi>Lyra</hi> takes this <hi>firſt Angell</hi> to be <hi>Pope Hadrian</hi> pouring out Anno 740. the <hi>boile of excommunication</hi> upon <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> whom he cals <hi>Iconomachus</hi> or <hi>Image-breaker.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Popes excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication is a noyſome ſore.</note> Rightly indeed he calls the Papall excommunication a <hi>boile:</hi> for never was there a more cruell peſt depopulating the Church then it: however it is not to the purpoſe here: becauſe this is a plague of the laſt times.</p>
                     <p>Which thing <hi>Foxe</hi> not obſerving (otherwiſe a diligent interpreter of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation) very unfitly applies this <hi>noyſome ſore</hi> unto the raging peſtilence which a little before the <hi>Diocletian perſecution</hi> (for fifteen yeers together) over ſpread the whole Romane Empire under <hi>Gallus</hi> and <hi>Voluſianus</hi> about the yeere 125. In which ſenſe this plague ſhould not at all belong unto the worſhippers of the beaſt in theſe times.
<note place="margin">Riberas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ribera</hi> underſtands it properly of incurable <hi>Vlcers,</hi> lying hid in the inward parts of the body, (like to the <hi>ſixt Egyptian plague</hi>) with which the worſhippers of his feined Antichriſt ſhall be tormented. <hi>Bullinger</hi> alſo and <hi>Aretius</hi> interpret it of the <hi>Spaniſh or French diſeaſe,</hi> common to the Clergy in their impure ſingle life. Others apply it to other grievous diſeaſes. But ſuch the godly alſo are inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent too: But not to the boile or ſore of this Viall.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Andreas</hi> therefore more rightly underſtands it of <hi>spirituall ulcers,</hi> or <hi>inward tortures and pangs of a corrupted heart, continually like a Scorpion biting and gnawing the minds of Apoſtates,</hi> that is, becauſe Antichriſt whom they worſhipped as God, cannot helpe them in their plagues and diſtreſſes. Notwithſtanding he addes, that happily externall ulcers alſo ſhall torment their bodies, to augment the griefe and torment of their ulcerous conſciences.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Brightman</hi> doth well obſerve that the conſtruction it ſelfe <hi>(There came a noyſome and grievous ſore upon men,</hi> for, <hi>in men</hi>) doth intimate an inward ulcer, inwardly troubling and vexing the hearts and conſciences of men, and he addes withall it is nothing elſe but <hi>malice</hi> and <hi>envy,</hi>

                     <p>By which indeed the Papiſts were wonderfully tormented at the pouring out of this <hi>Viall:</hi> for as ſoon as <hi>Luther</hi> began to oppoſe popiſh Indulgences in <hi>Saxony, Zwinglius</hi> and <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> to extinguiſh Purgatory in <hi>Helvetia:</hi> It is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to conſider what hatred, malice, ſorrow, fury, and madneſſe theſe ulcerous Prieſts, <hi>Monks, Schoolmen, Cannoniſts, &amp; Biſhops</hi> were poſſeſſed with, what argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:96676:217"/>and counſells ſought they not, to extinguiſh this new flame? Certainly this griefe was more tedious and painfull unto them, then any <hi>Egyptian ulcer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt Viall therefore being poured upon the <hi>earth,</hi> that is, on the Regions of Bohemia, Germanie, and a while after on France, England, Denmarke, &amp;c. begate foule ulcers in the minds of the Papiſts, which are ſo far from being cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as yet, as on the contrary we ſee the Monks and Sophiſters of our time more ulcerous then thoſe of old.</p>
                     <p>I apply the Earth,
<note place="margin">The firſt viall chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fell on Germany.</note> under the <hi>firſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iall</hi> principally unto <hi>Germany,</hi> becauſe (I know not by what deſtiny) Antichriſt hath more bewitched the Germanes then other people, ſo as they are ready to beleeve, do, or ſuffer any thing whatſoever, for the ſake of the <hi>beast,</hi> yea ſome have not been aſhamed to boaſt, that the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, at the Popes Commandement, for the redemption of ſoules, would with the beaſts of the field have eaten graſſe, had it not bin for Luther:</hi> O wretched ſoile! yet by how much <hi>Germany</hi> was deeply drown'd in the Gulfe of Superſtitions, by ſo much the Lord in mercy hath pittied them, and vouchſafed the greater grace unto them, above other Nations.

The Sea ſhall be like to blood, which is poured out when a man is ſlain: or it ſhall be ſo red as if it were dyed with the blood of many men, and all Fiſhes in it ſhall die, as in the River of Egypt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the greater part of Interpreters acknowledge that this corrupting of the
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:96676:217"/>
                        <hi>Sea</hi> is myſtically to be underſtood: for indeed the turning of the Ocean into blood,

                     <p>To come therefore to the myſtery,
<note place="margin">Lyras opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> firſt I paſſe by the hiſtoricall gloſſe of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> touching <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> who, as he ſaith, poured out this Viall, that is, the vengeance of God <hi>upon the Sea,</hi> viz. on the <hi>Saxons</hi> whom he vanquiſhed, which are ſignified by the Sea, becauſe of the multitude of that people.
<note place="margin">The conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Gagnaeus.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>I paſſe by alſo the conjecture of <hi>Gagnaeus</hi> the <hi>Popiſh Commentator,</hi> that the <hi>ſea</hi> ſignifies the gentiles, becauſe of their manifold worſhippings of divers gods whoſe blood (whether it be corporally or ſpiritually taken) is largely to bee pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out. But they erre from the Scope, not obſerving that here is treated of the plagues of Antichriſt.</p>
                     <p>Moſt of our Interpreters underſtand the <hi>ſea</hi> to be the <hi>world,</hi> or the chiefe men of the world, or <hi>Ilanders,</hi> who ſhall become like corrupted blood, becauſe God will bring upon them all kinds of horrible warres, peſtilence and deſtruction, <hi>that every ſoule,</hi> that is, the greater part of the wicked ſhall miſerably periſh, or, that all that aſſent to Antichriſt in perſecuting of the Saints ſhall periſh through finall damnation: which opinion is not unfit, yet too generall: foraſmuch as the world was never free from war, peſtilence, and deſtruction: And the godly have allwayes had no leſſe ſhare in theſe evils then others: but theſe plagues ſhalbe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to Antichriſtians.</p>
                     <p>Therefore we are more nearly to conſider what this <hi>ſea</hi> is:
<note place="margin">What this Sea is.</note> whether that of <hi>Glaſſe</hi> which Iohn ſaw before the throne Chap. 4.6. and on which ſtood the <hi>Conquerours of the beast</hi> Chap. 15.2? But it ſeemes not to be the ſame, becauſe this here is a <hi>watery Sea,</hi> the other <hi>of glaſſe.</hi> Again, whether it be that into which the <hi>burning Mountaine</hi> was caſt, Chap. 8.9? It is not, for that denoted the world of the faithfull, that is, the Church, which the Mountaine of the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire had almoſt overwhelmed: But this here is the <hi>Antichriſtian SEA,</hi> becauſe one of the laſt plagues is poured upon it.</p>
                     <p>Or, whether it be that out of which the <hi>Beast aſcended,</hi> Chap. 13. ver. 1? It ſeemes to be the ſame: for the <hi>ſea</hi> there ſpoken of, may be taken two wayes: either for the pit, whence the <hi>beast aſcended,</hi> Chap. 11.7. but ſo it is not here taken: Or for the vile aſſembly of <hi>Epiſcopall councels</hi> by whoſe authority, chiefly after the <hi>ſixt age,</hi> the Monarchicall power of the <hi>Romiſh chaire</hi> was eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: thus it ſhould be the ſame. Therefore <hi>Brightman</hi> doth not unfitly (as it ſeemes) determine, that this <hi>ſea,</hi> is <hi>the Councell of Trent,</hi> into which from the yeer 1545. unto 1563. under five Popes, viz. <hi>Paulus</hi> 3. <hi>Julius</hi> 3, <hi>Marcellus</hi> 2. <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> 4. and <hi>Pius</hi> 4. the <hi>Rivers</hi> and <hi>Fountaines</hi> out of all parts of the Antichriſtian world did unburthen themſelves as it were into a Sea, that is, thither were gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red 9. <hi>Cardinalls,</hi> 3. <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> 33. <hi>Archbiſhops,</hi> 233. <hi>Biſhops,</hi> 7. <hi>Abbats,</hi> 8. <hi>Generalls,</hi> 4. <hi>Counſellours at Law,</hi> 149. <hi>Divines,</hi> 11. <hi>

But what was done? The <hi>waters of the ſea became as the blood of a dead man,</hi> that is, corrupted and mortall, hence <hi>every ſoule living in the ſea dyed,</hi> for the <hi>Decrees of Trent</hi> were <hi>bloody,</hi> that is written (and ſo indeed generally they were) with the blood of hereticks: But (being falſe and deſtructive) by their filthy and deadly ſavour, they killed the ſoules of all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures, ſwimming or ſeeking for life in this ſea.</p>

This indeed is true, but expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not the meaning of the propheſie, becauſe that which followeth: <hi>Thou ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt them blood to drinke,</hi> doth not cohere with this ſenſe: for God gave not blood to drinke to theſe rivers and fountaines, that is, layd not a cruell puniſhment on them, in regard they had ſhed the blood of the godly.</p>
                     <p>Therefore ſuch falſe Prophets are not here ſimply to be underſtood, who one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by their falſe doctrine kill the ſoules, which the <hi>Sea of Trent</hi> did by its filthy and corrupt blood, killing all that tooke in the ſame, which was the ſecond plague: But ſuch cruell falſe prophets, who either with their owne hands, or by their bloody counſells: and condemnatory ſentences ſhed the blood of innocent Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. But who are they?</p>
                     <p>We muſt keep to the Allegory of the <hi>Sea, Rivers, and Fountaines.</hi> The <hi>ſea</hi> hath its continuall courſe, and is nouriſhed by the flowing waters of rivers and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines: ſo likewiſe the fountaines and rivers have their moiſtneſſe from the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour of the Sea: hence they are rightly called the <hi>breaſts of the Sea,</hi> becauſe they both ſuck for themſelves, and give nouriſhment to the Sea. The <hi>Sea</hi> was <hi>the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering together of Biſhops and Doctors in Councill.</hi> The <hi>Rivers</hi> therefore and <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of Waters,</hi> who are they, but <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Doctors,</hi> not indeed belonging to the Councell, yet chief Antichriſtian Pillars and Champions for Popery.</p>
                     <p>Thus alſo in Chap. 8.10. the <hi>Rivers and Fountaines</hi> were Biſhops and Doctors of the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſucceſſours of Pope <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> whom he (being corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through the favour and liberality of <hi>Constantine</hi>) drew with himſelfe from Heaven into the Earth, and made bitter the wholſome and ſweet Doctrine of Chriſt by the wormewood of humane traditions, as there I declared. Therefore here alſo the <hi>Rivers and Fountaines</hi> are Biſhops and Teachers, but in time diverſe from them. Thoſe were made bitter before Antichriſts riſing: Theſe here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their cruelty after Antichriſts declining. Theſe therefore <hi>became blood,</hi> that is, they ſhall pay their own blood for the blood which they ſhed of the Saints. The time and manner whereof the Lord knoweth:
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet:</hi> 2.17.</note> whom I beſeech to bring theſe rivers and fountaines to repentance. Therefore I thinke that the event of this <hi>Viall</hi> is propheticall, which as yet wee have not ſeene, and perhaps under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>And I heard the Angell of the waters</hi>] In Chap. 14. ver. 18, This Angell is ſaid to have <hi>power over the fire:</hi> here he is called <hi>the Angell of the waters,</hi> hence aroſe the opinion that ſundry Angells are ſet over ſeverall elements.</p>
                     <p>The Papiſts alſo hence have feined that their <hi>tutelar Saints</hi> are appointed over diſeaſes, Arts, Handi-crafts, Cities, Countries, and every member of man. But hence nothing can ſolidly be gathered: for the <hi>Angell of the waters,</hi> is not a <hi>Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi> ſet over the waters: but it is the ſame Angell pouring the Viall on the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and Fountaines: ſo called, becauſe God by his miniſtery turned the waters into blood: after the ſame manner the <hi>firſt Angell</hi> might be called the <hi>Angell of the earth,</hi> the ſecond the <hi>Angell of the ſea,</hi> the fourth the <hi>Angell of the Sun,</hi> &amp;c. becauſe they poured out the Vialls on the earth, ſea, ſunne, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Becauſe thou hast judged thus</hi>] He declares God to be juſt in judging theſe things, that is, becauſe he turned theſe cruell and curſed <hi>Rivers and Fountaines

Now the Angell aſcribes them not to men but God, affirming them to be moſt juſt, in regard they ſingularly agree to the rule of <hi>diſtributive ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi> which renders rewards to the juſt, and puniſhments to the wicked.</p>

                        <hi>For they have ſhed the blood of Saints</hi>] By the Law of requitall they celebrate the juſtice of God: becauſe they ſhed blood, therefore with blood ſhall they be puniſhed. <hi>For hee that ſheddeth mans blood: by man ſhall his blood be ſhed.</hi> Gen. 9.6.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thou gaveſt them blood to drinke</hi>] Bloody waters are not to be drunke, yet ſuch ſhall be the drinke of the adverſaries. The hiſtory of <hi>Cyrus</hi> is knowne, whoſe head being thrown into a great Tub full of blood, <hi>Tomyris</hi> queen of <hi>Scythia</hi> upbraiding his cruelty, ſaid: <hi>Drink thou blood who couldest not be ſatiated with blood.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But thou wilt ſay, whoſe blood either of the Saints or Prophets have they ſhed? For anſwer to this, (not to ſpeake of the ſecret Plots, Conſpiracies, and poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings ordinary to Monkes and their Confederates) read <hi>Foxe</hi> his booke of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi> and thou ſhalt ſee who they were that put to death, even in England alone, multitude of Saints and Prophets, many Biſhops, Doctors, and Teachers, very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, learned, and innocenr perſons: As <hi>Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer, Hooper,</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Martyrs, who in <hi>Queen Maryes</hi> dayes for their conſtant profeſſion of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelicall Doctrine, and oppoſition of Idolatry, were condemned, ſome to the fire, others to other torments: Who I pray have been the architects of all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies, Plots, and Commotions in the neighbouring Nations? Let Hiſtories ſpeake. Rightly therefore the innocent blood of the Saints is imputed unto them by the Angell.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For they are worthy</hi>] Their cruelty is the reaſon why they juſtly drinke blood. The Angell rejoyceth not ſimply over the plagues of the wicked, but declares the juſtice of God by the law of requitall. Every one ſhall be rewarded accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what he hath done: <hi>for this is the judgement of God, that they which commit ſuch things are worthy of death,</hi> Rom. 1. verſe 32. God therefore is righteous, and ſo are his judgements on blood-thirſty men.</p>

And although indeed Antichriſt be plainely diſcovered: yet what ſhifts and feined pretences doth he daily make, to the end the world may not take notice of him? But by how much the day of Iudgement drawes nearer, by ſo much the more ſhall the light of the Sun, that is the Scriptures, bring to the eyes of the world a more abundant and clearer light: <hi>The ſumme</hi> of all is, that a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perſpicuity of the Scriptures ſeemes to be expected, by which Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans as by a more vehement heat of the Sun, ſhall be very much tormented: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the filtineſſe of Antichriſt will hereby be more diſcovered, which ſhall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion them to perſecute men with the greater hatred, yea ſuch ſhall be their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding folly, as they will rage and fret againſt the <hi>Sun,</hi> becauſe their filthy whoordomes are laid open to the view of all the world.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This ſenſe</hi> is clearer then the former: yet both are to one effect: for Chriſt
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:96676:220"/>by the ſcriptures will ſend forth a great light and new heat, which indeed ſhould rejoyce the adverſaries, amend them, bring them to repentance, but through their owne malice they ſhall be the more enraged thereby. Now all things will be cleare.</p>

                        </gap> the phraſe denotes ſome extraordinary judgement of God: For indeed neither Chriſt nor his word do in themſelves, or of their own nature worke this effect, <hi>viz.</hi> to torment men with the ſcorching heat of fury, but the ſunne is given or attributed unto them accidentally: God ſending on Antichriſtians <hi>ſtrong deluſion that they ſhould beleeve a lie, becauſe they received not the love of the truth.</hi> They ought indeed by the beames of the Sun of righteouſneſſe ſo cleerly ſhining in the holy Scriptures, to be enlightned, warmed and ſtird up to acknowledge, love and imbrace the truth of Chriſt: but they maliciouſly in heat of fury will rage againſt Chriſt, and be tormented by fire, that is, extreame malice and envy.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Having power</hi>] By this attribute he aggravates their fury: they ought hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie to intreat God to take away the plagues: who onely hath power, (as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, ſo) to remove the ſame: but they like mad men, will not ceaſe to ſet their faces againſt the ſun, and to blaſpheme God to their inevitable ruine and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: for at laſt they ſhall be neceſſitated to fall under their plagues.</p>
                     <p>Here by the way we are admoniſhed that God is the orderer of all ſcourges: from which if we deſire to be freed, we muſt humbly turne our ſelves by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication unto him.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Andreas</hi> thinkes <hi>the throne of the beaſt</hi> to the be Kingdom of Antichriſt, which (ſaith he) ſhall be darkned by this pouring out, becauſe it ſhall altogether ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, and be wholly deſtitute of the light of the ſun of righteouſneſſe. He underſtands it therefore of the darkneſſe of doctrine, wherewith <hi>Antichriſts Kingdome</hi> ſhall be utterly overwhelmed: from which opinion our interpreters, as <hi>Bullinger, Marlorate, Alphonſus, Artopoeus, Aretius, and Chytraeus</hi> do not much differ, ſave onely that they interpret <hi>the throne of the beaſt</hi> more clearly then he, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Popiſh Kingdom</hi> and its groſſe Idols, errours, and horrible darkning of the truth, which at laſt ſhall be diſcovered by the light of the Goſpell.</p>
                     <p>But hardly any one is ſo abſurd as <hi>Ribera,</hi> who ſaith that the Kingdome of his feined Antichriſt ſhall be darkened, <hi>becauſe all his worſhippers ſhall be ſmitten with grievous wounds, and ſo their proſperity and joy obſcured.</hi> But he too much wreſteth the metaphor of <hi>darkeneſſe,</hi> for not the proſperity of Antichriſtians, but the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> that is, the power of Antichriſt is ſaid to be darkened: Hereby alſo this plague ſhould nothing differ from the firſt.</p>
                     <p>But what if the <hi>throne of the beaſt</hi> be the <hi>ſeat of the Pope of Rome?</hi> and the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Rome,</hi> its ſpoyling and ruine: of which ſee Chapter 17. ver. 16,</p>

                        <hi>Artopoeus</hi> therefore thinketh that the ſpoyling of the City Rome by <hi>Charles</hi> V. <hi>Duke of Borbon</hi> anno 1527. is here ſignified, but ſo this plague ſhould not have been very great: for the Emperour ſoon reſtored the Pope again: neither did there thence follow greater darkeneſſe to the Papall kingdom then before.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Brightman</hi> applies <hi>this darkening of the beaſts throne</hi> to the laſt deſtruction of the Rome, by which the dignity thereof ſhall not onely be a little leſſened, but wholly periſh according to the verſe of <hi>Sibyll</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>Then thou ſhalt be wholly in aſhes, as if thou hadſt never bin Rome.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe he thinkes that the <hi>beaſt</hi> ſhall remaine ſometime after the deſtruction of the City, not to regaine his former dignity, but that ſoon after a more horrible deſtruction may befall him. Therefore his <hi>Kingdome</hi> is ſaid to bee <hi>darkened,</hi> not wholly exſtinguiſhed, but deprived of its former luſtre.</p>
                     <p>For mine owne part, I dare not ſimply diſapprove of this propheticall ſenſe: eſpecially ſeeing the Ieſuits themſelves begin to propheſie of the deſtruction of Rome, and baniſhment of the Pope, as before in Chap. 14. I ſhewed out of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bera.</hi> For though the <hi>Turke</hi> ſit ſtill, yet certainly Chriſtian Kings and Princes will put their hands to this worke of God, for to thruſt the Pope out of his neſt: as Iohn Chap. 17.16. doth not obſcurely intimate.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding if it be thought more agreeable not to reſtraine <hi>the Throne of the beaſt</hi> to the City Rome, but rather to underſtand the ſame of his whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which is ſaid to be darkened, becauſe in the <hi>Egyptian Type</hi> (for it is a plain Alluſion unto the <hi>ninth plague of Aegypt</hi>) not onely <hi>Pharaohs</hi> royall Court,
<note place="margin">Ex. 10: 23</note> but the whole land, except <hi>the dwellings of the Iſraelites,</hi> was overwhelmed with moſt thick darkneſſe three dayes together: I ſee not to whom I ſhould rather aſſent, then to our foreſaid interpreters, who expound it of the darkening, or totall dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in which Antichriſt hath deeply involved and plunged the Chriſtian world theſe thouſand yeers, which ſhall wholly be diſſipated by the cleare light and preaching of the Goſpell.

                     <p>
                        <hi>The darkening</hi> therefore of <hi>Antichrists Kingdome,</hi> is not a bringing in of a new darkeneſſe: for his kingdom was never inlightned with the light of true doctrine: But began to be darkened even from the firſt, after that <hi>the ſmoake of the bottomleſſe pit</hi> had filled all parts and places thereof with a moſt groſſe myſt or blindneſſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the world in regard of its externall luſtre thought it to be moſt bright and ſhining. But the full manifeſtation of the <hi>darkeneſſe,</hi> and diſpelling of the <hi>ſmoak,</hi> ſhall be a fatall darkning unto Antichriſt, when the moſt cleare light of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell ſhall breake forth and ſhine in all parts of the world: for then the <hi>beaſts</hi> abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations ſhall be layd open to the view of all men: whereupon many ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert him: his glory ſhall be obſcured, his authority deſpiſed, and his Kitchin grow cold.

                     <p>Firſt, <hi>they gnaw their tongues:</hi> By which proverbiall Speech is noted the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame rage they ſhall fall into: And the cauſe is added: to wit, <hi>for the paine</hi> or griefe in which they ſhall be becauſe of the fatall declining of the Popiſh King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: for mad or furious perſons uſe to bite their lips, tongues, and fingers, and gnaſh their teeth as beaſts not able to revenge themſelves. It may alſo be an Alluſion to ſuch as have the Falling-Sickneſſe, who by the ſharpe ſits of their diſeaſe are wont to bite their lips and fingers: with the like madneſſe or phrenſie, the Papiſts ſhall then be vexed, when they ſee the <hi>Popes Kingdome to be darkened,</hi> expoſed to contempt, and the authority thereof taken away: when Kings, Princes, and the Vulgar ſort ſhall deny obedience unto the ſame.</p>

                     <p>Here alſo I ſee our <hi>Brightman</hi> to keep to the Letter about the <hi>drying up of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi> but in a diverſe ſence and end. <hi>Euphrates</hi> in this place, as in Chap. 9.14. in the <hi>ſixt Trumpet,</hi> he underſtands to be the River of <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> which made the paſſage of the Eaſterne People into <hi>Judea</hi> very difficult: The waters whereof he thinkes after the overthrow of Rome, ſhall be dryed up by a like miracle as of old it happened at the red Sea and the waters of <hi>Iordane.</hi> To what end? <hi>That the way of the Kings that come from the riſing of the Sun might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared:</hi> that is, that the Iews dwelling in the Eaſt may the eaſier and more ſpeedily returne unto Ieruſalem their native Countrey, not to reſtore the Iewiſh worſhip, but to embrace the Goſpell of Chriſt.
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.10</note> And he ſaith further that the converted Iews are called <hi>Kings,</hi> becauſe all Chriſtians <hi>are Kings and Priests to God:</hi> And <hi>Kings of the Eaſt,</hi> becauſe they ſhall come from thence, and all the Eaſtern peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall be in ſubjection to them.
<note place="margin">Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>This opinion he backes with four reaſons.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe it was never heard, that ſuch a miracle happened to any Nation, but the Iews, who paſſed thorow the red Sea and Iordan as on dry ground.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> becauſe the Prophet Iſaiah in Chap. 44. ver. 22. &amp; 51.10. &amp; 63.11. ſemeth to promiſe unto the Iews ſuch a kind of paſſage, namely that the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhould be dryed up in their return unto Ieruſalem.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> becauſe the Apoſtle Rom. 11.25. hath foretold that in the laſt times the Iewiſh Nation ſhall with great zeale turne to Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> becauſe it is not probable that ſo great a myſterie as their converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould be paſſed by in this propheſie. Now either it muſt here be mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or elſe it is not at all ſpoken of in this Booke.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have clearlie laid downe the opinion of this Interpreter,
<note place="margin">Not very ſolid.</note> which indeed is pious, ingenious, much deſired by the godlie, and perhaps probable alſo: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his arguments are of little waight.</p>
                     <p>For though it be granted that the <hi>drying up of the Sea and Iordan</hi> was peculiar to the Iews: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> yet hence it will not follow that the <hi>Kings of the Eaſt</hi> ſignifie the Iews to be converted to Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the <hi>drying up of Euphrates</hi> we read nothing thereof, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> but only in this place now in queſtion: neither is the ſame promiſed by the Prophet Iſaias, but the Iews aſſurance touching their deliverance out of Babylon is confirmed by the miracles which God of old had wrought for them.</p>
                     <p>The myſterie foretold Rom. 11. hath partly been already accompliſhed, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſome Iews now and then having been converted to Chriſt: and partly yet remaines to be fullfilled, when many every where in <hi>Europe Aſia &amp; Africa,</hi> ſhall imbrace the Goſpell, yet without a miraculous paſſing over <hi>Euphrates</hi> (beyond which it is not certaine that any Iews do inhabit) or returning into their countrey: ſeeing the faith of Chriſt is not in the leaſt tyed to the Territories of Iudea.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Laſtly,</hi> this myſterie is not paſſed by in ſilence, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> but was before plainely figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out in the <hi>Viſion of the</hi> 144000. <hi>ſealed ones</hi> out of the twelve Tribes of Iſrael. Chapter 7.</p>
                     <p>But what ever his reaſons are, this one thing moves me not to aſſent thereunto: becauſe either in theſe words <hi>of the drying up of Euphrates, the ſixt plague</hi> is pointed at, or elſe here is no plague at all; for the following words ſet not forth a plague, but the <hi>Beaſts</hi> endeavour to defend himſelfe (although in vaine) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſame.
<note place="margin">The drying up of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates is myſtically to be under ſtood.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>I think therfore that <hi>the drying up of Euphrates</hi> is rather myſticallie to be taken.</p>
                     <p>Now I find two myſticall interpretations (for <hi>Alcaſars</hi> new and fooliſh o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion I leave to himſelfe) which ſuppoſe, that the place here is a manifeſt allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:96676:224"/>unto the taking of Babylon by <hi>Cyrus</hi> who drawing the ſtreame of <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> another way, made the River ſhallow and paſſable, to the ſpoyling of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, through the middeſt whereof it ran.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Euphrates</hi> denotes the Turkes now poſſeſſing the ſame:
<note place="margin">Artopoeus opinion.</note> The <hi>waters thereof</hi> drawne out into other Brooks, the ſtronge incurſions of the <hi>Turkes</hi> on the <hi>Romane Empire,</hi> whoſe Princes being diſtracted becauſe <hi>of the darkening and weakning of the Beaſts Kingdome:</hi> ſome of them deſiring to ſee it overthrown: on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary others wiſhing the ſafety thereof: hence refuſe to joyne their forces toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for to reſiſt the power of the Turkes, who by this meanes ſhall the more eaſily breake in from the Eaſt and ſpoile them, as hitherto experience hath taught us. This is the opinion of <hi>Artopoeus,</hi> which I rehearſe, not becauſe I altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther approve thereof (for ſo the Plague ſhould no more appertaine to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, then to us) but becauſe it is not altogether diſagreeing from what we ſee by daily experience.
<note place="margin">Bullingers opinion.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But the other</hi> I much preferre before all the reſt, <hi>viz.</hi> which <hi>Bullinger, Aretius,</hi> and <hi>Illyricus</hi> have learnedly expounded, that <hi>Euphrates</hi> ſignifies the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Fortreſſes of the <hi>Antichriſtian Babylon,</hi> and by meanes whereof it grew to ſo great power, and hitherto hath ſtood in its ſtrength: namely their ſpirituall <hi>Revenues, Tithes, Firſt-fruits, Taxes, Annuities, Copes, Indulgences, Peter-pence, Impropriations, Diſpenſations, Vacancies, Commendums:</hi> to be ſhort, all the wealth and riches that were wont to flow to Rome out of all parts of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
<note place="margin">The waters of Euphrat.</note> 
                        <hi>Theſe waters ſhall be dryed up,</hi> becauſe theſe Taxes and Tributes former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly payed to the <hi>Beaſts kingdome ſhall be</hi> as was ſaid, <hi>darkened,</hi> that is, no more flow to Rome, but be beſtowed otherwhere, ſo as the <hi>Cheſts, Cellars, Kitchins,</hi> and <hi>Store-houſes</hi> of the Pope ſhal grow empty. <hi>The Way ſhall be prepared for the Kings of the East, to take Babylon,</hi> that is, without any let or hinderance kings, Princes, and People of all ſorts ſhall foreſake Antichriſt, <hi>Tread the Beaſts kingdome under foot,</hi> &amp; embrace the goſpel. <hi>The Kings</hi> I ſay <hi>of the East</hi> metaphorically are ſuch as hitherto were adicted to Antichriſt, but then embracing and profeſſing the Goſpell: (for the faithfull are <hi>Kings</hi>) <hi>&amp; ſhall come from the Eaſt,</hi> that is, from Chriſt, who is the <hi>Day-ſpring from on high,</hi> Luke 1.78.</p>
                     <p>The Analogie of this myſticall interpretation is proved both by divine and humane hiſtorie. <hi>Herodotus,</hi> and <hi>Xenophon</hi> witneſſe, that <hi>Babylon</hi> had two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple Fences: <hi>One</hi> without, <hi>viz.</hi> Their Walles, being fifty Cubites thicke, and two hundred Cubites high: <hi>The other</hi> within, <hi>viz. Euphrates</hi> running through the middeſt of the Citie, being of ſuch a depth that two men, howbeit ſtanding one on the necke of another, yet no part of their bodies would appear above water, as <hi>Gobryas</hi> in <hi>Xenophon</hi> ſpeaketh:
<note place="margin">The hiſtory of Cyrus in taking of Babylon.</note> ſo that the River was of greater ſtrength to the City then the Walles. Notwithſtanding the <hi>kings of the Medes</hi> came and beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Babylon,</hi> viz. <hi>Darius the Mede,</hi> and <hi>Cyrus the Perſian,</hi> according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of Ieremy in Chap. 51.28. <hi>Prepare againſt her the Nations, with the kings of the Medes,</hi> that is, <hi>the kings comming from the East:</hi> for <hi>Media and Perſia</hi> lies to the eaſt of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Now the Beſiegers deſpairing to winne the Walles took counſell how to divert <hi>Euphrates:</hi> for which purpoſe having made many deepe ditches, in the ſame night that the Babylonians were at their riotous feaſtings and ſo overcome with wine and ſleep, the <hi>waters of Euphrates</hi> were brought into the aforeſaid ditches, and the enemy paſſed through it into the City on dry ground, took the pallace of <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> killed him, and wonne Babylon, as we have it in Daniel 5. ver. 30. &amp; Ier. 51.32. <hi>her paſſages were ſtopt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>To this Type the thing in hand doth very well anſwer: for the <hi>Antichriſtian Babylon</hi> hath chiefly by two Monuments ſtood unmoveable. <hi>Outwardly</hi> in ſtead of walles,
<note place="margin">The walles of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.</note> ſhe hath Emperours, kings and nations, who as Vaſſals to the Pope do at his becke, take up Armes in defence of Babylon: <hi>Within her is Euphrates</hi> draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Rome as through a deep channell, the treaſures of the world, in ſo much as the <hi>Churches Eſchequer</hi> doth far ſurpaſſe the Treaſures of all Monarchs in the
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:96676:224"/>earth. It hath bin obſerved, that in moſt Provinces Clergie-men have had <hi>Two-thirds</hi> of all rents, ſcarcely one third remaining to the Prince and people: Thus as <hi>Babylon</hi> gloried becauſe of her deep waters: ſo <hi>Rome</hi> boaſteth of her exceſſive riches: but like as <hi>the waters of Euphrates being diverted,</hi> the River was dryed up,
<note place="margin">The deepe waters of the Romish Babylon.</note> and thereby an eaſie paſſage was prepared for the kings of the Eaſt, who tooke Babylon in one night: Even ſo Romes holy tribute being intercepted and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved otherwhere, there will be an eaſie way made for faithfull kings and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers to paſſe as through dry Foordes,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rev:</hi> 18.8</note> that new Babylon may fall in one day and bee deſtroyed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If thou aske,</hi> who ſhall make the ditches, and turne theſe Tributes of Rome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother way: See the <hi>History of Cyrus:</hi> his army wrought day and night, till at length the worke being finiſhed, <hi>Cyrus</hi> himſelfe opened the Sluces and drew the waters from the City: ſo the continuall labours and endeavours of Gods mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſhall prepare the ditches: and <hi>Cyrus the Lords anointed</hi> Iſay 54.1. that is, faithfull kings and princes ſhall themſelves open the more thus prepared, draw backe the Rivers of Babylon, and convert her Tributes to better uſes, as in Chap. 17. ver. 16. is plainely taught unto us.</p>
                     <p>Thus we have heard the meaning of the <hi>ſixt Viall,</hi> which without doubt is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and true, for <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall receive no plague more grievous then this, before the totall deſtruction thereof.</p>
                     <p>Neither is this interpretation new, or lately thought of by us: but even my <hi>Anonymus</hi> hath expreſt the ſame 260. yeers agoe, in theſe words: <hi>He dryed up</hi>] <hi>that is, The preaching of the Gospell doth and ſhall cauſe men to take away all temporall things, that is, Poſſeſſions and earthly Dominion from the Clergy, and they ſhall no more be given unto them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Neither are <hi>the waters of Euphrates</hi> onely begun to be dryed up a little: but almoſt a hundred yeers the way hath bin a preparing <hi>for the kings of the Eaſt,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade Babylon: Thus <hi>Bohemia</hi> in a great meaſure is fallen off from Antichriſt, and long agoe hath denied to encreaſe Babylons waters: The like we ſee in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, Scotland, Denmarke, Swethland,</hi> with a great part of <hi>Germany, France, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Hungarie:</hi> And what would ye thinke, if at laſt the waters of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> ſhould be dryed up alſo?</p>
                     <p>But let us ſee the induſtry of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> in keeping off this plague. While <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> of old prepared the motes and built Turrets before the walles of <hi>Babylon,</hi> they ſcorned him, and therefore it was no wonder they periſhed on a ſudden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their ſecuritie. But the <hi>Romiſh Babylon</hi> will more carefully ſtand on her watch, and make the ſiege of the Eaſterne kings tedious and difficult, as it followeth.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. <hi>And I ſaw come out of the mouth of the Dragon</hi>] The internall effect of the <hi>ſixt Viall</hi> we have heard ſpoken of: <hi>The drying up of Euphrates,</hi> being the <hi>ſixt plague of the Beast.</hi> The <hi>externall</hi> effect now followeth, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Beaſts Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage unto the Kings of the earth to make Warre,</hi> for to keepe off the plague. The Connexion is to be conſidered. By <hi>ſix Plagues</hi> the beaſt is almoſt waſted.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. By the venemous ulcer on ſuch as had the <hi>marke of the beast.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>Now becauſe the <hi>Beasts kingdome</hi> ſhall ſeem by all theſe plagues to be brought to a moſt deſperate condition: he on the contrary will leave nothing unattemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for to uphold the ſame: And as the Poet ſpeaketh:
<q xml:lang="lat">Flectere cum nequeat ſuperos, Acharonta movebit.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore to advance his throne againe, and bring backe <hi>the waters of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates into the Channells of Babylon,</hi> he will not feare to lift up his hand againſt

But with what event? Here indeed it is not mentioned, but ſhall be declared in the following Viſion Chap. 19.

                     <p>But becauſe this laſt tumult ſhall be raiſed by the <hi>Beaſts Legates,</hi> Iohn here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth in order, from whom they are ſent, and to whom, who, and what manner of Meſſengers they are, wherefore they are ſent, together with the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of their Meſſage: all which things we will briefly conſider.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>Here <hi>Ribera</hi> erreth, in thinking that theſe <hi>Kings</hi> are the ſame unto whom the way was prepared by the drying up of <hi>Euphrates:</hi> for they were Kings of the Eaſt, ſpoiling the beaſt: But theſe are the <hi>Kings of the earth</hi> and <hi>of the whole world:</hi> The former were againſt, Theſe ſhall be for Antichriſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Kings of the earth</hi>] Thus he calleth (as before) the <hi>ſworne Vaſſalls of the Beaſt,</hi> and therefore they are ſaid to be <hi>of the earth,</hi> however by profeſſion they would ſeeme to be Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And of the whole world</hi>] That is, all Forraigne Kings whatſoever: for at laſt the <hi>beaſt</hi> will labour to have the friendſhip and aſſiſtance of them all. For in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard he ſhall ſee that they of his owne profeſſion are more remiſſe and negligent then he would have them, therefore by Ambaſſages he will ſtirre up Forraigne Princes, and by all meanes labour to draw them on his ſide.</p>
                     <p>Now if thou demaund who theſe <hi>Legates</hi> are, I anſwer:
<note place="margin">Who theſe three ſpirits are that are ſent forth.</note> (howſoever undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly they ſhall manifeſt themſelves ſo much the more, by how much Antichriſts fighting againſt God ſhall appeare, and the nearer we come to the day of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: yet) it ſeems not to be obſcure in the leaſt, both by hiſtory and experience. For it is plaine that the chiefe of theſe Meſſengers, are the <hi>Legates a latere:</hi> who are ſent with full power unto <hi>the Kings of the earth</hi> to negociate for <hi>Babylon:</hi> next to them are the <hi>Biſhops</hi> who order and direct the affaires of the Court: In the next place are the Monkes and Ieſuites who inſinuate themſelves into the cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets of women, dive into counſells, and are Architects of diſſention; Theſe (as their own Epiſtles witneſſe) are daily ſent as Legates to the kings of <hi>India, Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> to bring them into the fellowſhip of this warre that is a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. And now of late (if I be not deceived) they have made the king of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia bounden to the Sea of Rome. And indeed without the religious interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe men, ſcarſe any counſells of peace or warre can be handled in Court, as experience teacheth.</p>
                     <p>Moreover this Type doth very fitly agree to Frogs. They are <hi>Spirits, viz.</hi> ſpirituall fathers: but <hi>uncleane like Frogs</hi>] <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith my Anonymus) <hi>they remain in the mire of riches prating and tatling againſt the truth of the Goſpell. Spirits of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills</hi>] <hi>becauſe</hi> (ſaith the ſame Authour) <hi>they are inſpired by the Devill onely ſo to doe. Working miracles</hi>] <hi>or doing ſignes,</hi> that is, <hi>making ſhew of outward holineſſe, though in truth they be the greateſt hypocrites, having their affections ſet on the earth and wordly Pompe, and therefore howſoever they be the trueſt Proctours of Antichriſt, yet being out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly cloaked with ſo many ſignes of Sanctitie, they captivate as it were all men, ſo that they are eſteemed of them more holy then the reſt of men.</hi> Theſe things <hi>Anonymus:</hi> but we are further to conſider, that by prodigious and falſe miracles they ſhall gaine credit to their Ambaſſage. <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch by which the beaſt himſelfe is ſaid to ſeduce the Inhabitants of the earth Chap. 13.14. Now it is notorious, that there are none at this day in the world, who arrogate to themſelves the glory of working ſignes and miracles, but the Popes Emiſſaries. Thus we ſee, who the Legates are, and to whom they go forth.</p>

            <p>Secondly <hi>that the ſcope and uſe indeed of this viſion in</hi> generall, <hi>is to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the adverſaries, that they might not be lifted up,
<note place="margin">The uſe of this Viſion,</note> becauſe of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, and preſume againſt the church in hope allwayes to eſcape unpunish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: as alſo to comfort the godly, leaſt being offended with the preſent outward luſtre and power of Antichriſt, and overcome by their manifold calamities, they should faint under the ſame, but in hope of a happy iſſue perſevere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly under the croſſe, fighting the good fight of Faith againſt the heaſt, and holding Faith and a good conſcience unto the end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the</hi> ſpeciall <hi>uſe thereof is clearely and manifeſtly to ſet forth to the world</hi> Antichriſt <hi>and his</hi> ſeat: <hi>For in regard the</hi> ſon of perdition <hi>shall ſit in the Temple of God, and by a pretended divine shew and lying ſignes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch the world, ſo as he shall be thought not to bee Antichriſt, but rather chriſts Vicar, and his kingdome the Catholicke Church: Therefore the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God would once for all unmaſke him, and by his owne finger as it were shew, that</hi> Rome <hi>is his ſeat, to the end that we might not ſuffer our ſelves any longer to be deluded by impoſtors, as if we were to ſeeke for Antichriſt at Ieruſalem, Babylon, or elſewhere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>It is not obſcure unto what times this viſion belongeth: The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell diſtinguisheth the age of the Beaſt by four periods of time: in which he</hi> was <hi>or</hi> had bin, <hi>in which he</hi> was not, <hi>in which he</hi> ſhall aſcend out of the bottomleſſe pit, <hi>and laſtly in which</hi> he ſhall goe into deſtruction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> firſt <hi>denotes the time in which the Beaſt was before</hi> Iohns <hi>time,

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> third <hi>is the time from Antichriſts riſing under the foreſaid</hi> Phocas, <hi>ſo long as the Papacy ſtood in its vigor and ſtrength, untill the declining ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of through</hi> Luther: <hi>for then the beaſt was aſcended out of the bottomleſſe pit.</hi>

            <p>Fiftly, <hi>We are alſo to conſider, ſeeing the beaſt is Antichriſt, what then should he meant by the woman</hi> ſitting on the Beaſt? <hi>Is shee not the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt? yea verily, for as a rider with the Beaſt makes one horſeman: ſo here, the woman with the beaſt makes one Antichriſt: we are therefore to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that like as in</hi> viſion fourth, C. 13. <hi>Antich. was figured out not by one, but by a double beaſt, in a divers reſpect: ſo in this</hi> ſixt Viſion <hi>he is repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not under one but a twofold figure, viz. of a</hi> beaſt <hi>and</hi> woman, <hi>yea a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man having the beaſt under bit and bridle.

                     <p>By calling her a <hi>whore,</hi> and a <hi>great</hi> one, that is, inſatiable, and far exceeding o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Strumpets in luſt and filthineſſe, he teacheth us, that the guilt and cauſe of her horrible judgement ſhall be her <hi>fornication,</hi> and not ſimply <hi>fornication</hi> (the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment whereof might happily not have bin ſo capitall) but joyned with dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable perfidiouſneſſe, namely her loathſome adultery: as when a Bride forſaking her Bridegroome, or a wife her husband, ſhamefully proſtitute themſelves unto ſtrangers, which ſin both by humane and divine lawes is puniſhed by death.</p>
                     <p>This may not be taken of corporall fornication: for this <hi>harlot</hi> is afterward called a <hi>Citie,</hi> and fornication could not be committed with the walles or houſes
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:96676:231"/>thereof. Therefore it is rather to be underſtood of <hi>ſpirituall fornication, viz.</hi> apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from God, perfidiouſneſſe and Idolatry: Now wherefore the ſcripture doth ſo often compare this to Fornication, I have ſhewed in my <hi>Commentary on Hoſea,</hi> Chapter 1. and Chapter 2.</p>
                     <p>Betwixt Chriſt and the Church is a ſpirituall mariage:

And thus the Apoſtle laboured to preſent the Churches of Rome, Corinth, &amp;c. as chaſt Virgins to Chriſt, that is, free from the leaven of Superſtition, idolatrie and humane traditions: ſuch a Church I ſay, was at <hi>Rome</hi> in the Apoſtles dayes and ſome while after, and here is repreſented in her apoſtacy by this <hi>woman</hi> the ſame Church as ſhall appear by that which followes.

In that <hi>Iohn</hi> doth againe ſay he was <hi>led by the ſpirit,</hi> as Chapter 1.10. and Chapter 4.2. it ſhewes that hee was not in a continuall Extaſie of Viſions.</p>
                     <p>The motion unto the Viſion was not of the body but the minde: for bodily he remained in <hi>Patmos,</hi> beholding there the <hi>wilderneſſe</hi> and the ſights with the eyes of his mind: like as <hi>Ezechiell</hi> bodily remaining in <hi>Chaldea,</hi> was in ſpirit in the Temple of Ieruſalem.</p>
                     <p>The place where he ſaw this, was the <hi>wilderneſſe.</hi> But what? Is the <hi>Woman, the Beaſt, Rome,</hi> and <hi>Antichrist</hi> in the Wilderneſſe? Do they not inhabit the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt poſſeſſions and moſt ſumptuous palaces?</p>
                     <p>I do not diſlike, that ſome underſtand by <hi>wilderneſſe,</hi> Gentliliſme, which Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt under the name of Chriſt hath brought into the Church: hence in Chapter 11.1. the <hi>Antichriſtian Clergy</hi> is ſignified by the name of <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And indeed the Antichriſtians imitating the Paganes, do fall downe before Idols of wood and ſtone made with hands: And as Paganes, ſo Antichriſtians make God beholding to them by the merit of workes: ſave onely that theſe abuſe the holy Name of Chriſt as a pretence for their Idolatry: which the other know not of.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding in my opinion there is an higher myſterie in it.

                     <p>This forſooth is that continuall <hi>ſucceſſion of the Romiſh Popes:</hi> This is the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable antiquity of the Popiſh Church:

                        <hi>I ſaw a wom in ſitting on a Beaſt</hi>] A monſtrons viſion. A woman being of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker Sex, and trembling as it were at the ſight of a mouſe, how ſhe ſhould not then be afraid of ſo cruell a Beaſt?

Now let us briefly conſider who this <hi>woman</hi> is, who the <hi>beaſt,</hi> and what the <hi>ſitting on the beast</hi> doth ſignifie.</p>
                     <p>That this <hi>woman</hi> is <hi>Rome</hi> is ſo clearly declared by the Angell,
<note place="margin">The woman is Rome.</note> that the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> dare no more deny the ſame: For <hi>Ribera</hi> howſoever on this place he ſeeks to ſhift off the matter, and altogether paſſeth by verſe 18.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Bellarmine</hi> howſoever he jeſtingly contendeth that Ieruſalem ſhall be the <hi>Seat of Antichrist:</hi> yet at length he granteth that <hi>Rome,</hi>

                     <p>Neither doth that fiction helpe them, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Popiſh Rome</hi> ſhall be burnt by the ten Kings before the comming of Antichriſt, and therefore cannot poſſible be <hi>Antichriſts Seat:</hi> for this Fiction is not onely contradictory to it ſelfe, but is greatly reproachfull to the Pope alſo.</p>
                     <p>

                        <note place="margin">And oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious to the Pope and cardinalls:</note> Nothing can be imagined more contumelious againſt the <hi>Pope</hi> then this Fiction: for if <hi>Popiſh Rome</hi> is to bee <hi>burnt</hi> for her <hi>Antichriſtian ſornication,</hi> then of neceſſity the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> muſt confeſſe one of theſe two things: Either that the <hi>Pope</hi> doth, or ſhall give to drink <hi>the wine of Antichriſtian fornication to the Kings of the earth</hi> (for this cannot be underſtood of any other whoredome) and ſo the Pope now is, or ſhall be the Antichriſt: <hi>Or</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> with his Cardinalls ſhall ſome time or other be taken with ſuch a Lethargy of Prophanneſſe, and be ſo careleſſe in their office, as to ſuffer the <hi>wine of the Babyloniſh fornication</hi> to increaſe in their Citie and Church, and then to be given unto the <hi>Kings of the earth:</hi> Now could this curſed <hi>wine</hi> grow in Rome, except the Pope and Cardinalls were the Authors and furtherers thereof?

                     <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">This beaſt as not the devill reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> this <hi>beaſt</hi> was not yet in Iohns time, but was to <hi>aſcend out of the pit:</hi> but the kingdome of the devill was in his time moſt cruelly exerciſed by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane tyrants</hi> againſt the godly.

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly the Dragon and the beaſt are not the ſame: for the <hi>Dragon</hi> gives his throne to the beaſt: And the beaſt receives his authority from the Dragon.

                     <p>Thirdly this <hi>beaſt</hi> ſo far as he comes up <hi>out of the pit,</hi> is the ſame mentioned in Chapter 11.7. who is there ſaid to <hi>aſcend out of the bottomleſſe pit,</hi> and Chap. 13.1. <hi>out of the Sea.</hi> Therefore hee ſaith <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>Iohn</hi> wonders not with an admiration of worſhip, as did the inhabitants of the earth, Chap. 13.3. but it was an humane aſtoniſhment at ſo horrid a ſight, and deſire to know the myſtery: for as yet he knew not what was meant by the <hi>wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> neither by her <hi>riding on the beaſt.</hi>

<note place="margin">Why the explication of the beaſt is darke.</note> It was enough that the ſpirit did declare the future events by ſuch ſignes as might not provoke the wicked: And by which the godly through con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall ſearching might attaine ſome knowledge of the Myſterie. Vnto the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the matter ought certainely to remaine obſcure, leaſt foreknowing the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, they might furiouſly preſume to hinder the ſame, and their rage bee the more encreaſed: But as for the godly, the holy Ghoſt would ſtir them up by an aenigmaticall interpretation, to the end they ſhould the more carefully attend to the events and hiſtories of their times: Notwithſtanding all things are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>involved with ſuch darke ſentences, but that he doth bewray with Characters e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident enough to ſuch as do not willingly ſhut their eyes, both the <hi>beaſt,</hi> that his <hi>ſeven heads</hi> are the <hi>ſeven hills</hi> of the City <hi>Rome:</hi> and the <hi>woman</hi> that ſhe is the <hi>Romane City and Church.</hi> Theſe Characters therefore are as it were the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of our interpretation: becauſe they will point out unto us as with the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the <hi>beaſt</hi> and the <hi>woman.</hi>

                     <p>To the <hi>Beaſt</hi> he aſcribes foure conditions or ſtates according to the times: <hi>He was, and is not, and ſhall aſcend out of the bottomleſſe pit, and ſhall goe into perdition.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ribera</hi> takes this <hi>beaſt</hi> to be the devill reigning,
<note place="margin">Riberas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the beaſt falſe.</note> as in Chap. 3. but it is abſurd, for the devill never ceaſeth to reigne in the children of unbeleefe, and even in Iohns time the Apoſtle Peter wrote, that the devill is <hi>allwayes going about like a roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Lyon ſeeking whom he may devoure,</hi> and therefore the Angell could not ſay to Iohn, The devill reigning <hi>IS NOT.</hi> Neither is it of waight what he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends of Chriſts Victory. <hi>Satan</hi> indeed is overcome according to his ſpirituall power, that he cannot exerciſe the ſame over the elect: but not according to his civill violence, by which in Iohns time he mightily raged in the <hi>Romane Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants</hi> againſt the godly. And what need was there I pray that Satan (of whoſe continuall rage the holy Ghoſt had ſo often advertiſed us without any figure) ſhould now be repreſented unto Iohn under an obſcure type, as if it were an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne Myſtery.

                     <p>

                     <p>Touching this opinion thus farre it may ſeeme to be imperfect, <hi>viz.</hi> that it diſtinguiſheth not ſufficiently the <hi>Romane Empire</hi> from Antichriſt: as alſo that it draweth the ſecond terme, <hi>IS NOT,</hi> unto the future deſtruction of the Empire: whereas the Angell denyeth that the <hi>Beaſt</hi> was in his time: laſtly that the third terme <hi>HE SHAL ASCEND O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T OF THE BOT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TO MLESSE PIT</hi> is moſt properly to be interpreted of Antichriſts riſing.</p>

Notwithſtanding he ſeemes to hold that the <hi>beast</hi> ſoone after <hi>Constantine</hi> did aſcend out of the Pit, which agrees not to the Viſions, and Hiſtories: For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Church, as ſoone as Chriſt left off riding on the <hi>red horſe</hi> under <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi> began to be blacke with hereſies, and with divers diſeaſes grew miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie pale even unto death, nevertheleſſe the <hi>Dragon</hi> had not as yet with <hi>his taile caſt downe that great Starre from Heaven unto the Earth,</hi> neither had the <hi>ſmoake out of the bottomleſſe pit</hi> wholly filled the Church with Antichriſtian Cloudes.

                     <p>Letting paſſe therefore both theſe Fables: we will now labour to find out the true meaning: And here againe, I propound two undoubted truths. <hi>One</hi> that the <hi>hornes of the beast</hi> are not the <hi>heads</hi> of the beaſt. <hi>The other,</hi> that the hornes are ſomething growing <hi>out of the heads.</hi>

<note place="margin">The ten kings are to be diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shed from the ſeven former.</note> becauſe the <hi>heads and hornes</hi> differ in forme and number, hence it followes: that theſe <hi>ten Kings</hi> are not Chriſtian Emperours, viz. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine the Great,</hi> with nine of his Succeſſours, as ſome do thinke, for theſe Emperours do neceſſarily belong to the <hi>ſixt</hi> or to the <hi>ſeventh head:</hi> becauſe they reigned before the <hi>beaſt</hi> came to be the <hi>Eight King</hi> or <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and they were true Emperours of the Eaſt and Weſt, neither received they their power with the <hi>beast:</hi> But theſe <hi>Ten ſhall receive their power in one houre with the Beaſt:</hi> neither ſhall they be ſuch Kings as the heads formerly were, but ſhall be <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">The kings received power from God.</note> becauſe although the tranſlation of the Empire (under which the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of other kingdomes is contained) was brought to paſſe by the raſhneſſe and boldneſſe of the <hi>Beaſt:</hi> Notwithſtanding God himſelf intending to puniſh the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine diſſentions and other ſins of the Eaſtern nations, did by means of a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and lawfull war of <hi>Charls</hi> againſt the <hi>Lombards</hi> (the deſtroyers of Italy and the Empire) juſtly tranſlate the Imperial ſtate from the Greeks unto the French: ſeeing <hi>it is God that ruleth in the kingdoms of men,

                        <note place="margin">1. <hi>kings</hi> 12: 2.</note> Therefore by this circumſtance, the ſpirit again points unto the hiſtory of <hi>Leo,</hi> that when he began to create Emperors and kings, Then alſo he began to be the <hi>Beast, and Eight king.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whence it is manifeſt that when the <hi>Romane Pope,</hi> boaſteth of the tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Empire from the Greeks unto the French and Germanes, he glorieth in nothing but in his owne wickedneſſe and ſeditious perfidiouſneſſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> becauſe the <hi>kings</hi> were ſo to receive power, as to have the ſame with the Beaſt, that is, to reigne with his favour, they ſhould have it, I ſay for his advantage not without the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> but with him, that ſo the <hi>Beast</hi> might reign with them and by them.

                        <hi>As,</hi> becauſe of the following matter which confirms this ſenſe, then of the obſcurity of theſe kings, who in compariſon of the former Mouarchy ſhall be but the ſhadows of kings as it were: although this ſenſe be alſo true, and agrees with the former.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding that which is ſpoken of <hi>(one hour)</hi> is not ſo to be taken as if all theſe kings received their power together, but with ſome difference of time: for if the <hi>laſt hour</hi> with Iohn in his <hi>Epiſtle</hi> includes diverſe ages? why then may not <hi>one hour</hi> here include certain years? As therefore thoſe <hi>kingdomes</hi> which were taken from the <hi>Romane Empire</hi> by the Barbarians, received not the Chriſtian faith together: ſo they received not their power all together with the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> but ſome before, others after (as it followeth) and ſo gave the ſame unto the Beaſt. viz: <hi>Italy, France, Germany</hi> and <hi>Britany</hi> ſooner: <hi>Spaine, Poland</hi> and the <hi>Northern</hi> king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, later.</p>

It is alſo in overcoming the Kings themſelves, who being in their conſciences at laſt convinced of the truth of the Reformed Religion according to the word of God, ſhall forſake the whore, lay downe their armes, and joyne to Chriſt, by ſetting up his Throne in their Territories. Thus the Kings have been, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall be overcome to their own good. There is beſides an externall Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
<note place="margin">Outward Victory.</note> for howſoever the Antichriſtian armies have many times (eſpecially in this our age) ſhed abundance of Chriſtian blood in <hi>Germany, Spaine, England,</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> unto the end they might ſuppreſſe the <hi>Lambe,</hi> and his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: yet have gained nothing, but rather by this meanes (though unwittingly) ſpread and propagated even that which they accuſe to be hereſie far and neer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong divers Nations: waſted and deſtroyed their own Provinces, bringing them under the power of ſtrangers, and been forced to give liberty to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: neither have they much oftner obtained bloody victories over the Godly, then they themſelves have miſerably periſhed by the ſword of Chriſt.</p>

                        <hi>For he is Lord of lords]</hi> The reaſon of the Victory is added, taken from the Majeſty and Power of the <hi>Lambe,</hi> in compariſon whereof all the forces of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and <hi>kings</hi> are but vanity: for the <hi>Lambes</hi> power and majeſty is divine and eternall.

<note place="margin">By burning</note> deſtroy and burne. This prophefie is ſo open and cleare touching the overthrow of <hi>Popiſh Rome,</hi> as the Ieſuites dare no more deny the ſame. And therefore we here ſee that <hi>Papall Rome</hi> ſhall be made deſolate, not by the Turkes, but by Chriſtian KINGS, the definite or certaine time thereof we know not:
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:96676:246"/>yet by what goes before it may be gathered without obſcurity that the time is near: for ſome <hi>Kings</hi> have already begun to hate and forſake <hi>the whore, making her naked, and eating her fleſh:</hi> ſome of the <hi>Ten</hi> yet remain with her: into whoſe hearts, what the LORD will put for them to do, himſelf knoweth: Perhaps more ſhall forſake the whore.

Neither will they any more <hi>fight gratis</hi> for the Whore, but ſell their protection of her for filthy lucre, emptying her Purſe as much as they can.</p>
                     <p>Here by the way to gratifie the Reader, I thinke good to ſet downe a propheſie taken out of an Ancient Munuſcript found in the Houſe of <hi>Sale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianus,</hi> and lately ſent to mee: which every one may credit, ſo far as it likes him. Certainly ſo much of it as concerns the deſtruction of Rome doth not aberre from the preſent Propheſie of his Booke. Now the words are theſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>There ſhall ariſe a King out of the Nation of the moſt Illuſtrious Lilie, having a long Fore-head, high Brows, great Eyes, and an Eagles Noſe: He ſhall gather a great Army, and deſtroy all the Tyrants of his kingdome: and ſlay all that flye and hide themſelves in Mountaines and Caves from his face. For righteouſneſſe ſhall be joyned unto him, as the Bridegroome to the Bride: with them he ſhall wage warre even unto the fourtieth yeere, bringing into ſubjection the Ilanders, Spaniards, and Italians: Rome and Florence he ſhall deſtroy and burne with fire, ſo as Salt may bee ſowed on that Land. The greatest Clergy-men who have invaded Peters Seat, he ſhall put to death: and in the ſame yeere obtaine a double Crowne. At laſt going over Sea with a great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, he ſhall enter Greece, and be named King of the Greekes. The Turkes and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians hee ſhall ſubdue, making an Edict: that every one ſhall die the death that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippeth not the Crucified one. And none ſhall be found able to reſiſt him: becauſe an holy arme from the Lord ſhall allwayes be with him. And he ſhall poſſeſſe the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the Earth. Theſe things being done, he ſhall be called the reſt of holy Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, &amp;c.</hi> Thus far the Propheſie.</p>
                     <p>Now to return to the <hi>Kings,
<note place="margin">Whether theſe kings be ten in ſucceſſion.</note> Brightman</hi> underſtands by the <hi>hornes, Ten Kings:</hi> not reigning all at one time in ſo many kingdoms, but ſo many <hi>Emperours</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding each other in the Romane Empire: and thinks that <hi>Charles V.</hi> was the firſt of thoſe, who taking Rome by force <hi>Anno</hi> 1527. did not a little ſhake it: <hi>Foure</hi> followed, none of which received their Crown from the <hi>Whore</hi> after the manner of their Anceſtours, or came to <hi>Rome to kiſſe his Holineſſe feet:</hi> yea all of them according to their clemency and prudencie gave freedom to publiſh the Goſpell in the Romane Empire: and by their example invited neighbouring <hi>Kings</hi> to the like clemency. God is to be intreated, that he will further put into their hearts to do what his pleaſure is.</p>
                     <p>As for the ſucceſſion, the <hi>Angell</hi> made the ſame moſt plain in the <hi>ſeven heads:</hi> but of the <hi>ſeven hornes</hi> not ſo: for <hi>theſe Kings ſhall receive power together in one houre with the Beaſt, and ſhall have one minde togither:</hi> firſt in defending, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in oppoſing the Whore. Therefore they ſhall be together, ſome ſpace of time onely excepted.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſſe <hi>Riberas</hi> fiction (which before I touched) hath no place of <hi>Ten Kings,</hi>

                     <p>For firſt in this he agrees not with himſelf:
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>in Apocal.</hi> 17. <hi>Sect.</hi> 18: 19.</note> 
                        <hi>When,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Antichriſt is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, They indeed ſhall have the names of kings, but in truth Antichriſt ſhall reigne, and they ſhall obey him. Here</hi> he will have that the <hi>Ten kings</hi> ſhall obey Antichriſt. And afterward: <hi>The devill,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and Antichriſt his chiefeſt limb aſſisted with the helpe and power of theſe kings, will be able to doe all the things, which are foretold by
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:96676:246"/>God:</hi> Now it cannot be queſtioned but that <hi>the things</hi> he ſpeakes of are the ſame which the <hi>Angell</hi> foretold ver. 16. <hi>viz.</hi> of conſuming the <hi>whores fleſh,</hi> and her burning by the <hi>kings.</hi> How therefore ſhould Rome be burnt by the <hi>Ten kings</hi> before Antichriſts comming, if the Devill and Antichriſt ſhall do this very thing by the helpe and power of the <hi>Ten kings?</hi> and how doth the fable confiſt, that <hi>three</hi> of them ſhall be wholly extinguiſhed by him, if all <hi>ten</hi> ſhall give their faithfull aſſiſtance unto him?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is an aſſertion altogether unprobable, that theſe <hi>ten</hi> ſhall then rule the whole univerſe: nay rather it is refuted by evident reaſon: For when Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt (whom they expect doth come) certainly there ſhall be ſome Chriſtian Kings to <hi>burne the whore.</hi> There ſhall alſo be ſome <hi>kings of the Earth,</hi> who ſhall lament her, and gathering themſelves into <hi>Harmageddon,</hi> ſhall fight an unhappy Battell againſt Chriſt. But the former and latter ſhal not be the ſame in the leaſt, as <hi>Ribera</hi> is forced to feine Chap. 18. Sect. 21. and Chap. 19. Sect. 34 becauſe both theſe and the other ſhall never have one and the ſame mind: therefore there ſhall others rule in the world beſide them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that falſe Fiction hath often bin refuted, viz. of <hi>Romes burning before Antichrists comming:</hi> for Babylon ſhall not be burnt before Antichriſt come: But Papall Rome is Antichriſt. Therefore Papall Rome ſhall not be burnt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Antichriſts comming. The aſſumption is before proved, neither can it be any longer denyed. The moſt certain proofe of the <hi>major</hi> is this, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rome is to be burnt not before but after Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</note> Babylon ſhall be burnt becauſe of her Antichriſtian fornication: but Babylon ſhall not commit fornication before, but after Antichriſts comming: becauſe the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> which is Antichriſt, &amp; whoſe <hi>hornes</hi> are the <hi>kings</hi> committing fornication with the whore, carries her on his back, yea on his <hi>ſeven heads,</hi> being the <hi>Mountaines</hi> on which the <hi>woman ſitteth:</hi> The which carriage or bearing doth ſignifie the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous commixture of both. Therefore Babylon ſhall be burnt not before, but after Antichriſts comming.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Laſtly</hi> adde hereunto, that the <hi>whore</hi> ſhall not be burnt before ſhe ſhall ſit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Beast.</hi> But the <hi>Beaſt</hi> is Antichriſt, and ſo <hi>Ribera,</hi> whether willing or not willing, is forced to confeſſe, Chap. 19.19. Sect. 31. and Chap. 20.10. Sect. 73. <hi>The Beaſt,</hi> ſaith he, that is, <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Where Rome</hi> ſhall not be burnt before Antichriſts comming.</p>
                     <p>There is yet one ſcruple,
<note place="margin">Whether Rome being burnt, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt shal be abolished</note> whether theſe <hi>Kings</hi> by burning the whore are to aboliſh Antichriſt.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, they ſhall not: for it ſhould be contrary to that of the Apoſtle: <hi>The</hi> LORD <hi>ſhall conſume that wicked one with the ſpirit of his mouth, and ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story him with the brightneſſe of his comming:</hi> not therefore by the <hi>arme of fleſh.</hi> Beſides it ſhould be contrary to this Propheſie, the which Chap. 19. affirmeth,
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2</note> that <hi>the Beaſt with the Falſe Prophet, and the kings of the Earth ſhall be cast into the lake burning with fire and brimstone,</hi> after that the <hi>Beaſt</hi> with the <hi>falſe Prophet,</hi> and <hi>kings of the Earth</hi> have fought their laſt battell againſt Chriſt. So that the <hi>burning of the whore</hi> ſhall indeed be very great, yet not the laſt or utter over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of Antichriſt. Antichriſts Neſt ſhall be burnt: The ſhop of abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, fullminations, tyranny, Popiſh Idolatry, and conclave of Cardinalls ſhall be deſtroyed. The Pope himſelfe and <hi>falſe Prophet</hi> ſhall flee out of Italy unto ſuch <hi>kings</hi> which yet ſhall adhere unto him, ſuppoſe the <hi>Spaniard,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ribera con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth the Pope shal be thruſt out of Rome.</note> or ſome other by whom he may find ſhelter.</p>
                     <p>Neither doth <hi>Ribera</hi> deny this, but often confeſſeth that after the deſtruction of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Pope notwithſtanding ſhall be the Romane Biſhop, although he ſits not at Rome: like as the Emperour of the Germanes is called <hi>Romane,</hi> howbeit he have not <hi>Rome,</hi> and as the Popes during the ſeventy years ſciſme were called <hi>Romanes,</hi> though they ſate at <hi>Avinion,</hi> and not at <hi>Rome.</hi> Thus we ſee the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty confeſſeth the Fact.
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ribera A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocal</hi> 14 <hi>ſect:</hi> 48.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Onely herein he ſtaggers, as not knowing where to turne himſelf, for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:96676:247"/>he feineth that theſe <hi>kings</hi> themſelves, other while that Antichriſt by their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance ſhall deſtroy Rome.</p>
                     <p>But his Fiction is frivolous: for the Kings that are to deſtroy Rome, ſhall not be Antichriſts friends, but his enemies: becauſe they ſhall <hi>hate the whore,</hi> who as ſhe is the <hi>Whore riding on the Beaſt,</hi> is one with Antichriſt, yea Antichriſt himſelf, as before we ſhewed. Therefore Antichriſt ſhall then be: nevertheleſſe he ſhall not deſtroy Rome by their helpe.</p>
                     <p>The Pope therefore or Antichriſt ſhall remaine ſome while after Rome is burnt, yet his ſtrength ſhall be mightily weakned. Now what he will further enterprize, we ſhall hear Chap. 19. <hi>viz.</hi> that laſt battell unto which he <hi>ſhall gather by the three uncleane ſpirits, the Armies of the Kings of the Earth in Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mageddon:</hi> the which beeing unhappily fought, hee ſhall bee caſt into the Lake of fire.</p>
                     <p n="17">17 <hi>For God hath put in their hearts</hi>] We have heard, by whom, and what the overthrow is that ſhall befall the <hi>Romiſh whore:</hi> Now thirdly he addes, who is the authour inflicting the ſame: and here the <hi>Angell</hi> by a certaine <hi>Anticipation,</hi> bids us to aſcend higher even unto God: For it might be thought a wonderfull thing, how the Kings, having been ſo long obſequious unto the whore, ſhould ſo ſuddenly change their mind, and turn their love into hatred, and ceaſing to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Chriſt, bend their ſword againſt the whore. Now this ſaith the Angell, happened not at a venture, but by the direction of God, for <hi>God gave,</hi> or put <hi>it into their hearts,</hi> that is, moved and bent their wills and counſells ſo to do: For <hi>the kings heart is in the hand of the Lord as the Rivers of waters:

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntill the words of God ſhall be fulfilled</hi>] This limitation is not of the finall conſummation, which is to happen at the ſound of the <hi>ſeventh and laſt trumpet,</hi> Cha. 10.9. for after the burning of Antichriſts Seat, and the alteration of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of the Kings, he ſhall notwithſtanding remaine and rage ſome while, but with very broken and weake attempts. Now the terme prefixed by God is ſhewed, that is, how long this <hi>holy League</hi> of the Kings, and Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and ſo conſequently their oppoſing of the Lambe ſhall endure: which being finiſhed, God <hi>put into the hearts of the Kings,</hi> that (their love of the whore being turned into hatred) they ſhould execute his judgement upon her.</p>
                     <p>The ſenſe therefore is, The <hi>Kings</hi> have thus long conſpired with the Beaſt, and committed fornication with the whore: <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntill the words of God</hi>] that is, his decree touching the riſing of Antichriſt, revealed in the words of the Prophets and Apoſtles be fulfilled: After the fullfilling whereof, God put into their hearts to hate the Romiſh Strumpet, that is, deteſt Popiſh Idolatry, embrace the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Chriſt, forſake, yea and oppoſe the <hi>Whore.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="443" facs="tcp:96676:247"/>
Why therefore ſhould we wonder, that ſo many great Emperours, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny religious Kings, of <hi>Germany, France, Spaine, England, &amp;c.</hi> have with ſuch zeale defended Popiſh Idolatry, the Romiſh Church, and Antichriſt the Pope, almoſt theſe 800. years, in defence of whoſe magnificence and glory, they have made ſo great wars, and ſhed ſo much Chriſtian blood? We hear that God did <hi>put it into their hearts,</hi> that they ſhould do ſo, and not otherwiſe, ſo that the Angell wills us to riſe from the events and ſecondary means unto the ſecret, yet juſt judgement of God.</p>
                     <p>Here againe we have cauſe greatly to admire, that after ſo long <hi>fornication,</hi> ſome of the Kings, as of <hi>England, Scotland, Denmarke, Sweethland:</hi> Many pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull Princes alſo of <hi>Germany, Bohemia, France, Poland,</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> having laid down their armes againſt the Lambe, and embraced the heavenly Doctrine of ſalvation, brought to light by the <hi>Two Witneſſes</hi> in the ages of our predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, do at this day <hi>hate the Romiſh Adultreſſe, and make her naked:</hi> We have cauſe, I ſay, to admire the Fact, and extoll Gods judgement to Heaven. Certainly the Kings did not repent either raſhly, or by their own underſtanding, <hi>God put it into their hearts</hi> that they ſhould repent of their whoredome, hate the whore and make her deſolate. The LORD is to be intreated that he will put the ſame into the hearts of the reſt of the KINGS, that is, to take knowledge, ſhun, and hate the Whore, and to give their power no longer unto the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> but unto the <hi>Lambe.</hi>

                     <p>Let us hear a third:

                     <p>Wherefore the two latter Ieſuites do in vain ſeek an evaſion, that not Popiſh but Heatheniſh Rome is this City: for they are confuted by <hi>Ribera</hi> their own companion, ingeniouſly confeſſing, that Heatheniſh Rome long agoe burnt to aſhes, by the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Vandalls,</hi> hath no place here: but that it is <hi>Popiſh Rome</hi> that now is: yet notwithſtanding he ſaith, that it is to be burnt before

                     <p>There remains three ſcruples to be diſcuſſed from ver. 17.</p>
                     <p n="1">I.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>How God puts into the hearts of Kings,</hi> that is, <hi>worketh in the hearts of men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impeachment of their liberty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">II.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Seeing God is ſaid to put three things into the hearts of the Kings: One in its owne nature good,</hi> viz. <hi>The hatred of the Whore. Two things in themſelves evill,</hi> viz. <hi>Their agreement with the Beaſt, and fight with the Lambe: Whither he puts this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner into their hearts: and whither it will not hence follow that hee is the Authour of ſinne?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">III.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In granting (which thing ſome maintaine) that theſe Kings were not converted, how then are they ſaid in ſpoiling of the whore to doe the will of God, ſeeing they were ignorant of it: Neither ſpoiled they her ſo much out of affection to piety, as of deſire to the prey.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Now firſt, how God workes in the hearts of men, the liberty of their will remaining.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of this Queſtion both in the Hypotheſis, and in the Theſis the explication is the ſame, being not a little difficult: For if God workes in the hearts of men, he ſeemeth to determinate or limit their wills to one thing: Now if God limit the wil, then man ſeems not to act freely: ſeeing that is ſaid to be free which is unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited in reſpect of a thing: Furthermore God ſeems to move and bend the wills of men according to his own will or pleaſure. But that which is moved and bent by anothers will, ſeems not to act freely.</p>
                     <p>Now the Scripture on the contrary ſaith: <hi>The Kings heart is in the hand of the Lord, he inclineth it to whatſoever he will:</hi> So the Holy Ghoſt in this place: <hi>God put into the hearts of the Kings</hi> that they ſhould do theſe, and not other things,</p>

                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Caiet. in</hi> 1. <hi>qu. Art.</hi> 4</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt is of <hi>Caietan:</hi> That the concurring or accord of the divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and free will is inexplicable, and not to be underſtood in this life. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> confeſſeth it to be dark, but not inexplicable.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond he aſcribes to <hi>Durand:
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Duran in</hi> 2. <hi>diſt.</hi> 37 <hi>qu.</hi> 1.</note> That there is required no concurring of the divine operation unto actions of ſecondary cauſes, but that is enough, if God preſerve the natures and vertues of the ſame.</hi> This <hi>Bellarmine</hi> rejects as falſe, for it is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Scripture. But whither it be <hi>Durands,</hi> let himſelf look to it. I have ſought
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:96676:248"/>for it, but find it not. It is abſurd. For how doth God not concurre unto actions, if hee concurre unto their vertues: ſeeing there is no influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the action, ſave from the influence of the vertue thereof.</p>
                     <p>The third is of others whom he is afraid to name: <hi>That God indeed by his concurrence doth determinaters or limit the will of man, and that in regard of it, Mans will cannot but act, and yet remaines free: either becauſe the concurring of God is not of the things requiſite unto the action of free will: or becauſe the divine deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination hinder not the judgement of our reaſon about chooſing or rejecting of objects, which is the root of the liberty in the will.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Againſt this opinion (which is true) hee largely diſputes. <hi>Firſt</hi> by the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Siracides,</hi> Chapter 15.14. <hi>That man is left in the hand of his owne Counſell:</hi> which is nothing to the matter, becauſe hee ſpeaketh there of man as hee was firſt created, or before his fall. <hi>Secondly,</hi> by the authority of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> which make nothing againſt it. At length by reaſon, <hi>viz. That this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination ſhould make God Author of ſin, The wicked excuſable,</hi> both being falſe,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Scot. in</hi> 2. <hi>de</hi> 37</note> as ſhall appear in the following Queſtion. At laſt he alledgeth two opinions, as he ſaith better, but indeed they are worſe. <hi>The former</hi> is of <hi>Scotus, That the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine cooperation is not of the part of the cauſe, but onely of the part of the effect,</hi> that is, that Gods concurrence doth not determinate the will, or imprint any thing in the ſame, but flowes immediately into the effect, and produceth the ſame in the very moment in which it is produced from our will. As when two Porters carry a great burden, which one alone could not do: here neither of them addes ſtrength to the other: but onely both bear the weight.</p>
                     <p>This opinion pleaſeth him, yet not altogether: for he ſees it is repugnant to the Scripture, which ſaith not, that the divine influence is in the actions, but in the hearts of men. As here <hi>God put into their heatts:</hi> he ſaith not, into their actions: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>The Kings heart is in the hand of the Lord, he inclines it to whatſoever he will:</hi> he inclines, I ſay, the heart, and not only the effects of the heart, or of the King. It is repugnant alſo to the prayers and practiſe of the Saints, who fervently deſire of God, to have not onely their actions and wayes directed, but likewiſe to have their minds enlightned and bearts guided by God.</p>
                     <p>The other opinion is of <hi>Thomas,</hi> which ſaith he,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>C.</hi> 1: <hi>q.</hi> 105 <hi>art.</hi> 5. <hi>&amp; Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>con. Gent. ca.</hi> 7 <hi>Et qu.</hi> 3. <hi>de potentia artic.</hi> 7.</note> perhaps is more probable (ſo ignorant is hee of that truth, which he undertakes to expound) <hi>viz.</hi> that the divine cooperation ſo concurres with the will of men, as it gives not onely ſtrength unto, and preſerves the ſame, but alſo mooves and applies it to the worke.</p>
                     <p>The which opinion beeing candidly taken, differs nothing from the third, and is true. But becauſe the truth pleaſeth not <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> he ſubtilly pretends that this opinion alſo hath its difficulties, and again by cavelling ſeeks to deceive: For you would thinke him to be ſome Iugler: for being a <hi>Thomist</hi> he dares not refute his maſter: therefore he ſhuffles by ſubtilty, and at length againſt <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> hee comes to this: that Gods concurring to the will of man, brings nothing ſave a <hi>negative</hi> determination, that is, none at all: and that the motion of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines ſubject to our will, and is in our power. Thus God and his grace ſhould be ſubject unto us: and ſo againe the Cart drawes the horſe.</p>
                     <p>Thus I ſay, the <hi>Sophiſter</hi> to make men free, makes them ſacrilegious. What therefore?</p>
                     <p>The opinion of <hi>Caietane</hi> is moſt true, that this concurring of God remaines in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>explicable to us in this life: for the divine providence hath a thouſand inexplicable wayes to inſinuate it ſelfe unto us, inwardly to incline, turne, bend, draw, and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate our hearts a new, that we by doing what we wil freely, yet do nothing but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the divine determination and appointment.</p>
                     <p>But if any thing can bee expounded touching this concurring, then the <hi>third</hi> and <hi>fift</hi> opinion muſt bee true: neither is our liberty endangered thereby: for to incline, move, bow, draw, and determinate the heart, is not to force men as
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:96676:249"/>if they were brutiſh or againſt their will: becauſe this inclination, motion, determination is not without the proper judgement of reaſon, and free electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the will. Now nothing but coaction, is repugnant to the liberty of the will.
<note place="margin">Whether the divine determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the will.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Yea,</hi> ſaith he, alſo <hi>determination</hi> is repugnant. This was the firſt argument: <hi>That which acteth determinately to one thing, acts not freely,</hi> &amp;c. This is true if determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation be put without the judgement and proper choice: otherwiſe it is falſe: for God himſelfe out of perfection of nature, wills that which is good, and hates the evill determinately, yet doth both moſt freely.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bell armine</hi> cannot deny this, But excepteth, that God is determinated from himſelf,

The queſtion is not whether li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty ſtands with this or that determination: but whether with any. If it may ſtand with ſome: he hath beaten the air by a long diſputation. But alſo man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminates himſelf in the act of election, through the laſt judgement of practicall reaſon: for without ſuch a determination the wil and choice of man ſhould be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all.

Notwithſtanding this determination is not done without the voluntary judgement of our reaſon and choice of the will, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any coaction, yet in a manner to us indeed inexplicable, but known to God: <hi>Who worketh all things after the counſell of his owne will.</hi>

                     <p>To the ſecond Argument: <hi>That which is governed by the divine providence, acts not freely,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I ANSWER,</hi> it is falſe, unleſſe it be underſtood with the ſame diſtinction: to wit, if it be governed by a providence without our own delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and choice.

<note place="margin">What it is to act freely</note> For the creatures freedom in acting, is not to act without the government of any, but with deliberation, and by a voluntary motion of its own will: although this motion be raiſed and ruled by another.</p>

                     <p>To conclude it is plain from theſe things in the <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> that God put into the hearts of the <hi>Kings,</hi> the liberty of their will remaining, to doe, what they did, determinately: and in the <hi>Theſis,</hi> that the concurrence of God governing and determinating the will of man, as he pleaſeth, doth not at all take away the liberty of the ſame.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. <hi>Whether God after the ſame manner put good and evill into the hearts of the Kings: and whether hence it will follow that he is the Author of ſin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Touching the <hi>good</hi> there is no queſtion about it, for this all that are godly doe willingly grant, <hi>viz.</hi> that God, as the Scripture ſaith, workes both the will and the deed, without overthrowing the liberty of our will, as before we ſhewed.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding <hi>Pelagius</hi> did not grant the ſame: and a <hi>Philoſopher</hi> will no more grant the determination of the will in vertue, then in vice. But the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher is anſwered by the doctrine of heathens themſelves, as erewhile wee heard out of <hi>Aristotle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and ſuch as follow him, object the <hi>Theologicall knot</hi> in evill things
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:96676:249"/>touching the cauſe of ſin. For if God alſo determine the evill of man (as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples the <hi>hearts of the Kings</hi>) as touching things evill in their owne nature, as ſuppoſe, to conſpire together with Antichriſt, and to fight againſt the Lambe: hereby God ſeems to be the Author, as it were of their evills, and the Kings ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable. This indeed <hi>Pelagius</hi> of old objected to <hi>Austin,</hi> as at this day the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagian Relickes,</hi> in pretence to maintaine the righteouſneſſe of God, as if it could not be otherwiſe maintained, but in the ſenſe of bare permiſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> that God is ſaid to do that, becauſe he permits it to be done.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>firſt</hi> the gloſſe of <hi>bare permiſſion</hi> is a manifeſt abuſing of ſundry places of Scripture, in which it is plainely affirmed, that God did, and that indeed moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily, which men have done moſt wickedly.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>By theſe and the like places both the evill works of men, and Satan are aſcribed unto God, not abſolutely, but in ſome reſpect, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo far as God by the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſheth his ſecret judgements: not as the authour of mans wicked deeds (God forbid) but as a moſt righteous performer of his judgements in, and by them: for to imagine that God executeth not his judgements, but barely permits them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees not with faith and godlineſſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> the gloſſe of bare permiſſion in many places would be blaſphemous: take for example the place in hand: Wilt thou ſay, <hi>that God put it into the hearts of the Kings,</hi> that is, permitted it to be put? Who then put it into their hearts? Thou wilt ſay, the divell: and hereby thou makeſt the divell to put that into the heart, which the Scripture expreſly ſaith, that God did: wilt thou make the devill to be God? Beſides the divell will never perſwade the <hi>kings</hi> to oppoſe the whore. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider therfore whither this thy gloſſe doth not by an open blaſphemy attribute ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans work to God, and on the contrary the work of God to the divell.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the gloſſe of <hi>bare permiſſion</hi> imports hereſie: for under it lies hid the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagian denyall of the divine grace and providence: and the eſtabliſhing of humane ſtrength againſt grace.</hi> For this gloſſe hath flowed if not primitively, yet chiefly from the School of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> as may be ſeen in <hi>Auſtin,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Cont. Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an cap:</hi> 3:</note> againſt whom <hi>Julian</hi> the Pelagian diſputes after this manner. As God is to be conſidered about the will in evil, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in good, but in the evil will he only works permiſſively, by ſuffering the ſame to ruſh on by its owne motion and deſire, but not by moving the ſame: Otherwiſe he ſhould be the Authour of ſinne. Therefore alſo he workes good in the will onely permiſſively ſuffering the ſame to act by its own ſtrength,
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:96676:250"/>but not by moving the ſame: otherwiſe the liberty thereof ſhould be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. This was <hi>Pelagius Logicke,</hi> the which very thing now a dayes, the Patrons of bare permiſſion, and Prepoſterous Defenders of Gods righteouſneſſe, do unwittingly maintain.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſhews both the premiſſes of the <hi>Pelagian</hi> ſubtilty to be falſe.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Propoſition</hi> is falſe, becauſe God workes one way in the good will, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way in the evill. The former he makes good of evill, whereas by nature he finds all to be evill, none good: but being made good by himſelfe, he moves them effectually: yet ſo as their liberty remaineth, as hath bin expounded. The latter he makes not evill, but finds them ſo.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>aſſumption</hi> is alſo falſe: for he not onely forſakes and ſuffers the wicked will (which he findeth) to ruſh on whether it pleaſeth, but alſo delivers the ſame over to Satan and their own deſires, yea moving and inclining the ſame how he will, that by doing the evill it wills, it becomes ſubject unto his judgement, ſecret indeed, but never unrighteous, in a manner whither explicable unto us, or inexplicable, as Auſtin ſpeaketh: and as in the fore-alledged examples we have ſeen.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding he is not the cauſe of ſin,

Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can cap.</hi> 3</note> for he uſeth the wicked will to execute his judgements moſt holily: neither is he any more the cauſe of the ſin which evill men commit, by executing his judgements by them: then the ungodly are the cauſe of the good which he worketh through them.</p>
                     <p>Luther againſt Eraſmus doth perſpicuouſly declare the matter by ſimilies: <hi>A Rider rideth well though he uſe a lame or halting horſe:
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>De ſer. arb. cap.</hi> 148:</note> The Artificer formes of putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied wood an artificious image: Notwithſtanding there is halting in the riding, not by fault of the Rider, but by the defect of the horſe. In the image is putrefaction, not through fault of the Artificer, but by defect of the wood.</hi> So by the ſelling of Ioſeph, the betraying of Iudas, God brought to paſſe unſpeakable good: yet in both wickedneſſe was committed: not indeed on Gods part, but by the perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the brethren, and of Iudas.</p>
                     <p>But thou wilt ſay, the ſame ſinnes are attributed, as to the wicked, ſo to God: True, if thou conſider the words onely, and not the meaning of the Scripture. Now this is done with great difference. They are aſcribed unto Satan and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men in regard of themſelves, and as they are wicked actions committed by them againſt the Law. But to God, ſo far as by accident they ſerve unto his ſecret judgements, which he uſeth to execute moſt righteouſly, even by wicked men doing moſt wickedly.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon of the diverſity comes partly from the divers end, partly from the forme of actions:
<note place="margin">The rule of final cauſes</note> for a different end makes different actions, according to the rule: <hi>Finall and impulſive cauſes make the differences of actions.</hi> Hence two do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame thing, yet do not the ſame: though both do ſomewhat, which is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good or indifferent, when as they have divers ends differing in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall qualitie.</p>
                     <p>Gods end is allwayes good: wicked mens evill: in the ſelling of Ioſeph his brethren fulfilled their hatred, againſt the Law; <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill.</hi> In the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Iewes, the Babylonians enlarged their Tyranny to the injuring of their neighbours, againſt the Law: <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteale.</hi> And therefore both theſe and the other did ſinne. But God to whom both theſe are attributed, Gen. 45.8. &amp; Iſa 10.7.19. had a moſt holy end in both, <hi>viz.</hi> Ioſephs exalting Gen. 50.20. and his peoples chaſtiſement according to the Law, Iſa 10.6. Therefore he ſinned not. Read the tenth Chapter of Iſaiah touching this diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of ends in the ſame worke, and thou ſhalt learne, that what the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> did moſt evilly, God by them did the ſame moſt righteouſly.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>forme</hi> of actions the diſtinction is more evident: for three things di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly to be conſidered, concurre in thoſe actions of wicked men, which God is ſaid to do. 1. The <hi>Motion.</hi> 2. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> or the <hi>vitiouſneſſe of the motion, and</hi> 3. <hi>the
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:96676:250"/>ſecret judgement of God.</hi> Motion is a naturall good thing: And therefore it is from God, in whom alſo the wicked live, move, and have their beeing. <hi>The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret judgements of God,</hi> are morally good, even workes of juſtice and mercy: And therefore are of right attributed to God. The <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> or <hi>pravitie of the motion</hi> prohibited by the Law, makes the motion vitious and ſinfull. This therefore is not of God: but remotely flowes from the devill, and more nearly from the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward will and malice of men: whenſoever therefore the workes of evill men are in Scripture attributed unto God, as affirming that God doth them, or that they are from God. This is not to be underſtood ſimply, but with limitation, that is, not in reſpect of the diſorder and pravity, but firſt in reſpect of the motions, ſo farre as they are naturall motions: ſecondly and chiefly in regard of the ſecret Iudgements, which God executes in, and by the ſame.</p>
                     <p>But here thou wilt happily demand whether it may not rightly be ſaid, that God doth permit ſins? yea verily: yet with a twofold limitation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> that to permit and to grant is not the ſame thing, as if God did permit men to ſin without puniſhing the ſame, like as ſome Magiſtrates permit Brothel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, where fornication is committed without puniſhment. Now God doth not ſo: for his permitting of ſin is not to hinder, but ſuffer that they ſhould be committed through the vitiouſneſſe of men, and concur with his Iudgements.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> we muſt not underſtand ſuch <hi>a bare permiſſion</hi> as is a ceſſation altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the divine providence in the workes of evill men (which thing onely is in queſtion betwixt us and the <hi>Pelagians</hi>) but reſtrained unto the vitiouſneſſe of their workes, being repugnant to the nature and Law of God. For herein God himſelfe doth ſomething, ſomething he doeth not, but permits it to be done by men. He <hi>permits</hi> ſins to be done, as they are ſins, not hindering the doing of the ſame, nor correcting ſinners, that they ſhould not ſin, whereas he could do both. But he <hi>doth</hi> two things. I. The motions and naturall actions themſelves of evill men, by a generall influence (as the Schools ſpeak) ſometimes alſo by a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall. II. His Iudgements or events, agreeing to his goodneſſe and juſtice, the which if he did not reſpect, he would never permit ſins to be committed, and this he doth by moderating and effectually directing as the ſins, ſo other means al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo comming in between, to make them ſerve to his judgements and ends, which he intends moſt holily: not only by a generall influence, but alwayes by a ſpeciall. Hence the wiſe man: <hi>ſhe alſo reacheth from one end unto another,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 8.1</note> mightily and comely doth ſhe order all things.</hi> Theſe things no man will deny unleſſe an Athieſt, who makes God the governour of the world, no other then to be a ſlothfull or brutiſh Idol of <hi>Fortune.</hi> See <hi>Luther</hi> touching the ſlaviſh will, Chap. 143.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. <hi>How theſe Kings in eating the fleſh of the whore and burning her, did that which was pleaſing to God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Queſtion in regard of our interpretation, is of no weight, for we have proved, that the <hi>Kings</hi> who before had <hi>given their power unto the Beast,</hi> and all their aſſiſtance to the <hi>whore,</hi> did afterward by a certain divine <hi>metamorphoſis</hi> or change, repent of the ſame. As therefore they <hi>hated the whore,</hi> according to the revealed will of God: ſo they ſhall rightly and in obedience to God, forſake, make naked, eat her fleſh, and burn her with fire: according to the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the heavenly voice: <hi>Goe out of her my people: Render unto her double: thou ſhalt overthrow their Idols: burne their Images with fire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But put caſe they did not repent, and ſo were not without ſin <hi>in ſpoiling &amp; burning the whore,</hi> yet herein they did the good pleaſure of God, not as it was their act but accidentally: for in committing the manifeſt wickednes which they intended: they together executed the ſecret judgement of God, which they intended not: Like as the <hi>Jews, Herod, Pontius Pilate</hi> in condemning <hi>Chriſt,</hi> did together,

                  <p>
                     <hi>The Angell did shew unto Iohn in the wilderneſſe in ſtead of the</hi> woman, <hi>the chaſt Mother of the Man-child, that is, the true Church of Chriſt,</hi> a Scarlet-coloured woman, a whore drunken with the blood of the Saints, ſitting on the Beaſt, <hi>that is, the adulterous Antichriſtian Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For</hi> Ribera (<hi>though he deny it on Chapter</hi> XVII.) <hi>is forced Chap.</hi> XIX. <hi>and</hi> XX. <hi>(where the caſting of the Beaſt into the Lake of fire is deſcribed) to confeſſe that this</hi> Beaſt <hi>denotes Antichriſt. Now the Angell had plainly ſaid before, that the woman was the great City, which in Iohns time had domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over the Kings of the Earth, the which could not be any other City but Rome. Of the ſame it was ſaid, that the</hi> Ten Kings <hi>ſworn-unto the Beaſt, who before had imployed their power in defence of his kingdome (at length his abominations being diſcovered, and hating his fornication, God ſo go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning their hearts) should deteſt the</hi> whore, <hi>forſake, uncover, eat her flesh and burn her with fire.

For as in <hi>Comoedies</hi> divers perſons come and go on the Theater: ſo we ſee done here.</p>
                     <p>In this <hi>ſixt Viſion</hi> the firſt perſon was the Angell having <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ialls,</hi> leading <hi>John</hi> into the wilderneſſe, and ſhewing unto him the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſh Strumpet on the Beaſt,</hi> and expounding the myſtery of both, which things being done, another Angell came forth on the Scene to declare the judgement of the whore under the Type of Babylon.</p>

                        <hi>After theſe things viz.</hi> which were acted and ſpoken by the former Angell: Of whom is expounded in three Verſes, whence he came, what for an Angell he was, what he did, and ſpake.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Deſcending from Heaven</hi>] The place from whence he commeth gives divine authority to his Meſſage. For he comes from <hi>Heaven,</hi> as Gods Herauld: and therefore publiſheth the judgement of Babylon in the Name of God: that ſo we might not queſtion, but all ſhall certainly come to paſſe,
<note place="margin">Who this Angell is.</note> which is foretold by this heavenly Meſſenger. Who he was, it is not needfull to enquire. The following deſcription ſheweth, that he was one of the chiefe Emiſſarie Angells of God: Neither is it of neceſſity, to underſtand it of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſeeing the action of this Viſion is diſtributed between many Angells.</p>
                     <p>This might be demaunded, whether theſe three Angells proclaiming the ruine of Babylon, be the ſame with the three mentioned, Chap. 14. The <hi>firſt</hi> of whom proclaimed the eternall Goſpell. The <hi>ſecond</hi> the deſtruction of Babylon in the ſame words, in which this alſo proclaimed it: The <hi>third</hi> deterred men with threatnings from worſhipping of the Beaſt, and committing fornication with the woman.</p>
                     <p>I ſuppoſe they are not the ſame: Becauſe the time and argument of the Act differs. The former came forth long before theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> when God in compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to his people was about to reſtore the Goſpell, ſuppreſſed by Antichriſt, and purge the Church from the dregs of Popery, which as we ſhewed, was firſt done by <hi>Wickleffe, Huſſe, Jerom of Prague,</hi> afterward by <hi>Luther, Melanchthon, Zwinglius, Calvin,</hi> and the following Preachers of the Goſpell: for theſe reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red both the doctrine of Grace, and firſt denounced the ruine of Babylon. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe Angels were preachers of the Goſpell. But theſe here come down from heaven long after, <hi>viz.</hi> when now the deſtruction of Babylon was at hand: and they declare onely propheſies revealed unto them in ſpeciall by God; touching particular future events. Therefore they ſignifie not ordinary Preachers, who now know not, nor foretell things to come, but are reall Angells, publiſhing new Oracles in the Name of God: Yea the middlemoſt ſeems to have bin either God himſelfe, or Chriſt, ver. 4.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Having great power</hi>] What he was is ſhewed by two Epithites, by which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the Angells in Scripture are commended, <hi>viz.</hi> ſtrength and glory. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells indeed are not omnipotent Spirits, yet they have great power, inſomuch as One was able in one night to deſtroy an Hundred and Eighty Thouſand of the Aſſyrian Army. Hence they are called <hi>strong, mighty,</hi> Pſal. 103.20. <hi>Bleſſe the Lord ye his Angells, mighty in ſtrength, &amp;c.</hi> The third alſo of theſe Angells <hi>is called</hi>

                        <hi>Mighty,</hi> ver. 21. as before Chap. 5. ver. 2. and Chap. 10.1. which we there interpreted of Chriſt becauſe of the circumſtances, which
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:96676:253"/>are not here. <hi>Great power</hi> therefore is attributed to this Angell for the comfort of the Godly, that they might not thinke, that the power and glory of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon ſhould be invincible. The power of one Angell ſhall ſuffice to overthrow the ſame. Notwithſtanding in the Greek, it is not <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>Great power,</hi> by which the greatneſſe of the buſineſſe committed by God to this Angell ſeems to be noted. And indeed the overthrowing of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall be a work more then ordinary.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And the Earth was lightned with his glory</hi>] This Majeſty ſhews that he was a heavenly Ambaſſadour of God, to terrifie the Adverſaries, and ſtrengthen the Godly. The Angells have not allwayes appeared with ſuch glory, but onely when there was occaſion: as at the publiſhing of the Birth of Chriſt: <hi>The Angell of the Lord came on the ſhepheards,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Act.</hi> 12.7.</note> and the glory of the Lord ſhone round about them.</hi> At Peters deliverance the glory of the Angell that delivered him filled the priſon. So here <hi>With the glory of this Angell the Earth was lightned,</hi> that men ſhould the more carefully receive his Meſſage.</p>
                     <p>I like well what <hi>Ribera</hi> addeth, that hereby is noted, that the judgement of Romes deſolation ſhould not be ſecret, but manifeſt to all. He confeſſeth therfore that here is treated of Romes deſtruction.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>And he cryed with a great voyce</hi>] Now follows what he did: <hi>Hee cryed mightily.</hi> Moſt Greek Copies have it <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> 
                        <hi>He cryed in a ſtrong great voyce:</hi> The Old Verſion: <hi>Cryed in ſtrongth.</hi> The ſenſe is the ſame: The voyce of this heavenly Herauld was vehement and moſt ſtrong, ſo as he might be heard of all, that none, through ignorance of the judgement at hand, ſhould remaine in Babylon. The ſtupidity alſo and deep ſecurity of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon is noted, which ſhall ſo lie drowned in pleaſure, that while her judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall ſound thorow the whole world, ſhe alone ſhall not be able, nor wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to hear the ſame.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Babylon is fallen, is fallen</hi>] He proclaimes the ruine of Babylon, as did the ſecond Angell, Chap. 14.8. Now it is an <hi>Enallage</hi> and propheticall <hi>Anadiploſis,</hi> for, <hi>it ſhall fall,</hi> it ſhall certainly, ſhortly, utterly periſh: the Proclamation of the former hath bin, and ſtill is dayly publiſhed: for the Preachers of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell have above an hundred years denounced ruine to Babylon: And not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without effect: for Babylon is fallen in many Provinces of <hi>Europe,</hi> Popery being overthrown and diſſipated by the preaching of the Goſpell: But the words here, <hi>Babylon is fallen, is fallen,</hi> are not yet fulfilled; becauſe ſhe is not as yet wholly brought to nothing: And therefore the time of this Angell is not yet come, but ſhall be a little before the deſolation of Rome. Now the forme of the Exclamation (as before we ſaid on Chap. 14. ver. 8.) is taken out of Iſai. 21.9. &amp; Ierem. 51.8. ſpeaking of the Typicall ruine of Babylon. In the like forme Iſaiah foretold the deſtruction of old <hi>Aſſyrian Babylon,</hi> which had oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Gods ancient people about an hundred years before it happened: After the ſame manner perhaps an Angell now may foretel an hundred years before it come to paſſe, the ruine of the new <hi>Italian Babylon,</hi> which hath ſuppreſſed the Church of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Now who this Babylon is, there is no queſtion about it: for before on Chap. 14.8. we have ſhewed it to be <hi>Rome.</hi> And Chap. 17. the <hi>Angell</hi> makes the <hi>ſeven Mountaines of Rome</hi> to be Antichriſts Seat: Laſtly the adverſaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves confeſſe it. And therefore the deſolation of the Roman City is here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, and it is indeed to happen before the laſt judgement: as the whole fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing matter ſheweth.</p>
                     <p>

The firſt cauſe is: In regard <hi>all Nations had drunke of the wine of her fornication,</hi> that is, becauſe <hi>Babylon</hi> hath filled the Chriſtian world with abominations and Idolatrous worſhip. The Propheticall Phraſe is before expounded on Chap. 14.8. where in ſtead of <gap reason="foreign">

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> as it is in Chapter. 14. the guilt of the whore is more expreſſed thereby.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond cauſe is <hi>fornication with the Kings of the Earth.</hi> Not corporall, for that could not be committed with a City: therefore we muſt underſtand it of ſpirituall fornication, that is, the Idolatry which Rome hath obtruded on the whole Chriſtian world, and which ſhe hath maintained by the approbation, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and zeale of the Kings her Vaſſals. Now what was that?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ribera</hi> ſends us backe to the Idolatry of old Rome, the which we have before refuted. <hi>First</hi> it is contradictory to hiſtories, which ſhew, that the Romanes did not obtrude their Idols on other nations, but made the Idols of all peoples their own, leaſt any of the gods ſhould not be worſhipped at Rome, Chriſt only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. <hi>Secondly,</hi> God hath not till now differred the puniſhment of <hi>Old Romes</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry and wickedneſſe:
<note place="margin">This forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Popish I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry.</note> but moſt grievouſly puniſhed the ſame long agoe, through the <hi>Vandals, Gothes, Hunni,</hi> who three or four times ſpoiled and ruina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Romane City. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> here is treated of <hi>Rome</hi> in the laſt times, which can be applied to no other then Popiſh Rome: now ſhe ſhall not be puniſhed for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers, but for her own whoredom: And therefore this <hi>fornication</hi> can be nothing elſe ſave Popiſh Idolatry, which the whole Chriſtian world hath drawne from the breaſts of Rome their Mother.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And the Merchants of the Earth are waxed rich</hi>] Here is a third cauſe, which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto hath not bin mentioned: The laſciviouſneſſe and riot of her Merchants. Through riot <hi>Magneſia</hi> and <hi>Colophon</hi> were loſt, according to the Proverbe: It was alſo the overthrow of <hi>Sibaris,</hi> and ſhalbe the ruin not of old Rome, which now is not, but of new Popiſh Rome, of whoſe riot, laſciviouſnes, Sodomie, ſimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny I need not ſay any thing, it being notorious to the world. Read if you pleaſe the ſelected Epiſtles of <hi>Franciſcus Petrarcha,</hi>

                     <p>But thou wilt ſay, the Angell ſeems not to note the riot, but the richneſſe of theſe Merchants. Now ſhould this be the cauſe of ſo great a judgement? Is wealth or merchandize in it ſelfe vitious? not in the leaſt: but becauſe theſe Merchants, being as it were maſters of new delights and pleaſures, were not inriched by honeſt trading, but as it is in the Text <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>by the power,</hi> (or abundance) <hi>of her laſciviouſneſſe,</hi> that is, becauſe to their own exceſſive gain, they have moſt earneſtly furniſhed the Romiſh whore with all manner of riot and delicacies. But who are theſe Merchants?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ribera</hi> here alſo ſends us to the riot, and merchandize of Old Rome. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe old Rome did much abound in theſe things: but ſhe hath ceaſed to be for a long time, and ſo it makes nothing to the thing here in hand: Neither did Old Rome obtaine her power and wealth by merchandize, but force of armes, not by <hi>Mercury,</hi> but <hi>Mars.</hi> Beſides theſe Merchants are called <hi>Great men, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Earth,</hi> ver. 23. Therefore they are not common Merchants, who bring in, and carry out ordinary wares, profitable and neceſſary for mans uſe. But that ſingular kind of merchandize, ſpoken of ver. 13. ſheweth that a ſpeciall rank of merchants is noted: for they ſhall <hi>buy and ſell the ſoules of men.</hi> What more palpable then that theſe <hi>Merchants</hi> are no other ſave Prelates and Princes, whom they call Eccleſiaſticall, and all the ſacrificing traders in ſpirituall wares, <hi>Friars, Monkes,</hi> &amp;c. And that this <hi>merchandize</hi> is that whole Court of conſcience, reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and unreſerved Caſes, Indulgences, Annuities, Vacancies, Commendums, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations,
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:96676:254"/>Tithes, and ſale of Eccleſiaſticall riches, through which Channels the wealth and treaſures of the Chriſtian world have flowed to Rome, and the whole Popiſh Clergy hath every where gathered ſo much riches, as that Kings, Princes, Earles, Cities, Communities, have ſcarcely wherewith all to maintaine their Politick State honeſtly.

Let therefore this unknowne voyce ſtir up our attention: unleſſe perhaps it were the voyce of God or Chriſt, becauſe he calleth the people <hi>His.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now the <hi>Firſt</hi> part (as we ſhewed in the <hi>Analyſis</hi>) is an exhortation to the Godly: <hi>Afterward</hi> the lamentation of Kings, and Romiſh Chapmen: <hi>Lastly,</hi> the joy of the heavenly inhabitants.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Exhortation</hi> the people of God are commanded, <hi>Firſt,</hi> to goe out of ROME, leaſt they pertake of her ſinnes and plagues: <hi>Secondly,</hi> to render unto her double.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Come out of her my people</hi>] This in Ieremy 51.45. was the voyce of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Iſraelitiſh people: <hi>Goe yee out of the midst of her, and deliver yee every man his ſoule from the fierce anger of Jehovah.</hi> Therefore here alſo it ſeems to be Gods voyce, becauſe (as I ſaid) he calls the people <hi>His.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The words do a little differ (yet the ſenſe is the ſame) and are directed unto all the Godly whomſoever, that either have bin, are, or ſhall be at Rome, not
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:96676:255"/>onely within her wals, but the limits of the Romiſh Iuriſdiction. We ſee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that as there was in Babylon of old, the very ſtocke of abominations, a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, but captive: ſo in the <hi>new Babylon,</hi> although it be the <hi>Seat of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> yet there alwayes hath bin, is, and ſhall be, ſome Godly and Elect,
<note place="margin">God hath ſome of his in Babylon.</note> but Captives. For by this people <hi>Rupertus</hi> well underſtands <hi>the Elect onely accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the counſell of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore as often as the Papiſts demand, If the Papacy were not the Church, where then was it before <hi>Luthers</hi> time? Let us alſo aske them, if Babylon were not, where then was the Church in the time of the Babyloniſh Captivity?
<note place="margin">The church before Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was in Babylon.</note> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the Old Church was in Babylon, but oppreſſed thorow captivity: So the Chriſtian was under the Papacy, captivated and oppreſſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Goe out of her</hi>] The Iſraelites were commanded to goe out of Babylon, <hi>firſt</hi> in heart: by ſhunning her Idols and abominations: After <hi>Seventy yeers</hi> bodily al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, by returning into Iudea under <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Both goings out of the new Babylon are commanded unto us, <hi>viz.</hi> with our hearts to flee and deteſt her Idols and abominations, and corporally alſo, as much as may be, to depart from Rome, and ſhake off the yoake of Babyloniſh Tyranny by vertue of the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement; <hi>Goe out of her.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By which <hi>firſt</hi> we may readily juſtifie our ſeparating from Popery: They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed accuſe us to be Schiſmaticks, Hereticks, who are fallen off from the Church: But we have not left the Church of Chriſt, but the Babylon of Antichriſt, God ſo commanding us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly</hi> the ſtupidity, or madneſſe of ſome is here reproved, who by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy deſire to ſee Rome, the Pope, Cardinals, and Romiſh Idolatry, run to Italy to the great danger of their health, Life, Eſtates, Conſcience, Salvation. Such alſo who enjoying the profits, and delights of Babylon, had rather remaine in her and periſh, then obey the commandement of God. Yea ſuch alſo who being enſnared by her baites, fall from Chriſt to Antichriſt, returning with the dog unto their former Vomit: Like to the Iſraelites who loathing the Heavenly Manna in the Wilderneſſe, deſired to returne to the onions and fleſh-pots in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt: but remembred not their former miſerable bondage, Taskmaſters, Scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Brick-ovens, &amp;c. So theſe indeed greedily embrace the fat Kitching of the Papacy, but thinke not upon the miſerable ſlavery of the Conſcience and Tyranny of Antichriſt. But as they luſting after their fleſh-pots and onions, at laſt miſerably periſhed in the wilderneſſe, and entred not into the promiſed Land: So let theſe looke to it, how in regard of their Apoſtacy they will ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their wounded conſciences at the hour of death, and what anſwer they will give Chriſt the Iudge at the laſt day.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Leaſt ye be partakers</hi>] Some weighty cauſes of the Commandement are added. <hi>The firſt</hi> is, leaſt they be defiled with her ſins: for he which dwels near a cripple learns to halt: and he that rubs a ſcabby perſon, may eaſily be infected. Our admirers of Rome, plead indeed that they can without wounding of the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be converſant there, and behold the <hi>Maſſe, Idols, and Pompe of Babylon:</hi> But their pretence is falſe, becauſe God forbids the ſame, and experience proves the contrary: for they are forced (at the leaſt) to uncover the head, bow the knee to the Maſſe, Idols, Pope, and by outward ſhews to give approbation to Babylons Idolatry, except they would endanger themſelves: But that this is to participate in their ſins, cannot be denyed by any ſound reaſon: for to ſhun ſinne is to avoid the occaſion thereof. Let ſuch therefore call to mind that true ſaying:
<q xml:lang="lat">Eſto procul Roma, qui cupis eſſe pius.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And of her Plagues</hi>] Another cauſe,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Lib.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 28.</note> leaſt being overthrowne by the fall of Babylon, we ſuffer juſtly for our raſhneſſe and backwardnes. <hi>Mice</hi> (as <hi>Plinie</hi> writeth) <hi>depart out of the houſe when it is ready to fall: and the Spiders first fall downe with their webs.</hi> A little before the <hi>Siege of Jeruſalem by Titus,</hi> there was
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:96676:256"/>heard a voice in the aire: <hi>Let us depart hence,</hi> whereby the Chriſtians were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to go over Iordan to <hi>Pella.</hi> Having therefore theſe examples, why ſhould not the Godly depart from Rome, being near to deſtruction, that they be not partakers of her plagues: for when a houſe falls, all that are under the roofe muſt of neceſſity periſh.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>For her ſinnes have reached</hi>] A third reaſon is taken from the revenging juſtice of God, which although it ſometimes deferre, yet at length it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the puniſhment of wicked deeds: <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>God hath a revenging eye.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This reaſon is amplified two wayes: <hi>First</hi> in reſpect of the ſins which are ſaid to <hi>have reached unto Heaven:</hi> Generally all greek Copies have it <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>They followed each other,</hi> one begetting another, ſo that like chaines faſtned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with many rings,
<note place="margin">What is meant by ſins to reach to Heaven.</note> they reached as it were up to Heaven. <hi>Andreas</hi> and <hi>Montanus</hi> have it <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>glued together,</hi> or as it were with lime or morter raiſed up to ſo great an heape, as it reached even to Heaven. This ſignifies the abominable heaping up, and filthineſſe of ſins, which is ſaid to <hi>reach up to Heaven,</hi> that is, by exceſſive guilt to draw down vengeance from God: By a like <hi>meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor</hi> God makes Kains parricide deteſtable, Gen. 4:10. <hi>The voice of thy brothers blood cryeth to me from the earth:</hi> And the filthineſſe of <hi>Sodom,</hi> Gen. 18:20.21. <hi>The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great: the cry of their ſinne is very grievous which is come unto mee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>RIBERA on this place ſaith well, <hi>That there is no ſinne, though never ſo little, but it comes even to Heaven, that is, unto the knowledge of God, although the ſcripture uſeth ſo to ſpeake onely of greateſt ſinnes, ripe for puniſhment.</hi> Now hence is refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the diſtinction of <hi>veniall</hi> and <hi>mortall</hi> ſins: for <hi>to reach to heaven,</hi> is not onely to come unto the knowledge of God, ſeeing he takes knowledge even of the leaſt that are committed, but ſo to take knowledge of them, as being a ſinfull vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Law, and therefore deſerving the puniſhment preſcribed in the Law. If therefore all (even the leaſt of ſins) do reach, and come unto the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, it followeth that all deſerve the puniſhment of the Law, namely death eternall: and that none in their kind are veniall, that is, do deſerve par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, not puniſhment: yet indeed by accident they become veniall to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full through the mercy of God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly the grievouſneſſe of her ſins are aggravated on Gods behalfe: who is ſaid to <hi>have remembered them:</hi> by an <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> or <hi>humane affection</hi> often in Scripture applyed to God, by which is ſignified not any forgetfullneſſe, but Gods goodneſſe and lenity: he is ſaid to forget ſinners, when he differs their puniſhment, and affords time of repentance, and wholly forgiveth them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent: And he is ſaid to <hi>remember,</hi> when the time of puniſhment is at hand: Thus in Chap. 16. ver. 19. <hi>Babylon is ſaid to come in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the fury of his wrath:</hi> which is repeated in this place.</p>
                     <p>Hence three things are briefly to be noted, the conſideration whereof ought to recall us from ſin, and ſtir us up to repentance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> that all our ſins, even the leaſt are taken notice of by God, and deſerve to be fearfully puniſhed, eſpecially if they be heaped up without repentance. Let no man therfore think to eſcape unpuniſhed, as if his evills were forgotten, or hid from the eyes of the Lord: for all the actions of men, as well evill as good, are open and bare unto him with whom we have to do.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> If we have a long time gone on in ſin without puniſhment, it is to be aſcribed to the patience of God, by which he leads us to repentance: Let us therfore take heed that we abuſe not his long ſuffering and forbearance unto ſecurity, Rom. 2.3.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lastly,</hi> that at laſt ſins being heaped up, God doth call them to remembrance, and will certainly puniſh them the more grievouſly, by how much he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:96676:256"/>the ſame; Let us therefore not perſevere in ſin, in hope to go allwayes unpuniſhed, but while God calls not our ſins as yet to remembrance, let us forſake them.</p>
                     <p>Now it may be demanded, what is that chain of ſin reaching to Heaven?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ribera</hi> here is ſilent, being conſcious to himſelf, that they are the abominations of <hi>Papall Rome,</hi> for either they are of <hi>Old Rome,</hi> or elſe of <hi>Popiſh Rome.</hi> Of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem they cannot be, foraſmuch as this <hi>Babylon</hi> by the Ieſuits own confeſſion is <hi>Rome;</hi> not <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> though before he falſly and againſt his knowledge ſo ſeined in Chap. 16.19. Neither can they be ſins of <hi>Old Rome:</hi> ſeeing the chaine of them was broken long ago by the rooting out of Paganiſme: Adde to this that the guilt thereof was long ſince expiated by the worſhip of Chriſtian Religion, as alſo by the puniſhments inflicted through the <hi>Gothes, Vandalls, Hunni,</hi> before Antichriſts riſing at <hi>Rome.</hi> Beſides God would not impute to <hi>Christian Rome</hi> the wickedneſſe of others: for <hi>the ſoule that ſinneth, it ſhall die.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ezec.</hi> 18.4.</note> It remains therefore that this chain or heape of ſins, is of <hi>Papall Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Furthermore theſe ſins ſhall be either of <hi>Popiſh Rome,</hi> or elſe of <hi>Rome</hi> inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Antichriſt, who (as they ſeine) is to <hi>reigne three yeeres and an halfe.</hi> Of this feined Antichriſt they cannot be: <hi>both</hi> becauſe <hi>Ribera</hi> gloſeth, Chap. 16.11.14: that <hi>Rome</hi> before the comming of Antichriſt ſhould utterly be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Ten Kings: As alſo</hi> becauſe in the ſpace of <hi>three yeers</hi> the ſins of their feined Antichriſt cannot in any probability encreaſe to ſo great an height, if we ſeriouſly conſider what is here ſpoken of his whoredomes, wares, merchandize, and great wealth: ſo that whitherſoever the Ieſuites turne themſelves, this heap of abominations reaching to heaven, is meant of none ſave <hi>Popiſh Rome,</hi> now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. Thus the Papiſts themſelves, except they be altogether brutiſh, may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what is to be determined of the worſhip, ſuperſtitions, Idols, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall politie of the Romiſh Church.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>REWARD</hi> (Gr. render) <hi>HER EVEN AS SHEE RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WARDED</hi> (rendred) <hi>YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                        </hi>] <hi>The ſecond</hi> Part of the Exhortation, that the godly ſhould repay double to Babylon: Which God inculcates by divers figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative words. 1. <hi>That they ſhould render,</hi> for, reward her, to wit, judgement. 2. <hi>Double unto her double according to her workes,</hi> for, afflict her twice as much as ſhe hath afflicted the Saints. 3. <hi>Fill to her double the cup of wrath,</hi> the ſenſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one with the former. 4. That by how much through pride and luxuriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſhe had lift up herſelfe above all Churches, Biſhops, Kings, Princes: by ſo much they ſhould not onely bring down, but alſo afflict her with torment and ſorrow: In the latter of which he alludes unto that in Daniel,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.36 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.4.</note> 
                        <hi>And hee ſhall exalt himſelfe:</hi> And to that of Paul: <hi>And exalteth himſelfe above all that is called God.</hi> By this diverſity of Phraſes her ſins are ſo much aggravated, as no puniſhment, or torment ſeems to be great enough for them: Withall the godly are ſtirred up in taking vengeance on her, to exerciſe all manner of ſeverity and puniſhment, not out of their own affection, but by the commandement of God.</p>
                     <p>But here two doubts are to be cleared.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First</hi> how this ſtirring up of the godly to revengement ſtands with charity, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and the commandement of Chriſt, <hi>Render not evill for evill:</hi> For the godly are rather to be dehorted from cruelty, then to be edged on therto.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The ſecond,</hi> how it agrees with equity and juſtice to render double, that is, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict a heavier puniſhment then the nature of the fault ſeems to require.</p>
                     <p>Vnto which two a <hi>Third</hi> may be added, ſeeing he commands us to render to Antichriſt according to his workes, which were wicked and abominable ſins: whither then we are commanded to reward wickednes with wickednes, theft with theft, murder with murder, perjury with perjury? Thus God ſhould command that which is abominable: Now that which God commands is right and juſt: and ſo it ſhould be no ſin to ſteale, commit adultery, forſweare, kill,
<note place="margin">Chriſtianus Gottlieb.</note> &amp;c. Which thing of late a <hi>Maſqued Sycophant</hi> did hence labour to maintain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="462" facs="tcp:96676:257"/>
But to the firſt it is <hi>anſwered,</hi> that the godly are not commanded to take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, but to rejoyce becauſe of the ſame, that is, they themſelves are not bid to <hi>burne Babylon,</hi> but to rejoyce that God by the Kings had brought ſo heavy a judgement on her: as if they ſhould ſay, take vengeance on her with <hi>God,</hi> and gladly ſubſcribe unto his righteous judgement: by how much ſhe hath rejoyced in doing injury unto you: by ſo much rejoyce ye over her juſt puniſhments. In this ſenſe it is ſaid that <hi>the Saints ſhall judge the world and Angels,</hi> 1. Cor. 6:2.3. and the <hi>Twelve Tribes of Iſrael,</hi> Mat. 19.28. to wit, as approoving of the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be executed by Chriſt the Iudge.</p>
                     <p>This opinion many of ours follow: <hi>Ribera</hi> alſo holds the ſame: If we take it thus, then it is not contradictory to Chriſts commandement touching ſhunning of revenge. Neither are the Saints bid to rejoyce over evill, or the torments of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but the righteous judgements of God.</p>
                     <p>But thou wilt ſay, they are not only commanded to <hi>rejoyce over her judgement,</hi> but to take vengeance on her themſelves: for as by the words: <hi>Goe out:</hi> they themſelues are commanded to go out: ſo by the words, <hi>Render unto her:</hi> they themſelves are commanded to do it: which ſeems to contradict the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt in the Goſpell.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I Anſwer:</hi> This muſt be underſtood by a Synecdoche, part being put for the whole. Therefore my <hi>Anonymus</hi> refers the command unto Preachers: <hi>REN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DER <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NTO HER,</hi> that is, <hi>Preach yee</hi> that ſo much be done unto her. Thus there is no difficulty: Neither is there any, though it be referred to the whole Company of the Godly, which conſiſts not only of private men, (unto whom indeed private revenge is prohibited by Chriſts Commandement:) But of godly Princes and Kings alſo:
<note place="margin">Anonymus a true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet:</note> 
                        <hi>for ſome of them,</hi> ſaith the ſaid <hi>ANONYM<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> ſpeaking of the ten hornes or Kings, <hi>who now hold with Antichriſt, ſhall at the preaching of the Goſpell be turned against him:</hi> the which thing we have before ſpoken of. So that here is commanded no private revenge to private men, but publick to godly Kings and Princes, into whoſe hearts the Lord will put this, uſing them as inſtruments for the overthrow of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Vnto them therefore and their military forces, this part of the Exhortation doth principally belong: and the manner is declared how <hi>God put that into their hearts,</hi> namely, becauſe by an expreſſe commandement he ſtir'd them up to this revengement.</p>
                     <p>Vnto the <hi>ſecond</hi> the Anſwer is more eaſie: he commands not to render double puniſhment for a ſingle ſin, or to afflict Babylon more grievouſly then ſhe deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: the which ſhould bee contrary to juſtice: but commands them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the double of thoſe afflictions, with which ſhe had tormented the Saints: and ſo much her ſins did require: for he ſaith expreſly: <hi>Double unto her double, according to her workes:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, becauſe her ſins deſerve double pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. For no puniſhment can be double in reſpect of ſin in the judgement of God, that is, more grievous then the fault: foraſmuch as all ſin deſerves eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall puniſhment: Or we may underſtand <hi>double</hi> not <hi>Arethmetically,</hi> but <hi>Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically,</hi> that is, of a moſt fearfull puniſhment agreable unto her deſerts. And the word <hi>Double</hi> is thus taken in the Prophets: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.2. God promiſeth to the people deliverance out of their Captivity, <hi>for,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhee hath received of the Lords hand double for all her ſinnes:</hi> that is, ſhe hath grievouſly and ſufficiently bin puniſhed. And <hi>Zach</hi> 9.12. he promiſeth to the <hi>new Church</hi> double happines, or double benefits in reſpect of the old Church, <hi>Even to day doe I declare that I will render double unto thee.</hi> So here: <hi>Double unto her double:</hi> for, puniſh her ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently according to her deſerts: In which ſenſe alſo Chriſt ſaith Luk. 6.38. <hi>Good meaſure, preſſed down and ſhaken together, and running over, ſhall men give into your boſome.</hi> Wherfore he wills not that the puniſhment ſhould exceed meaſure.</p>
                     <p>Vnto the <hi>third:</hi> It is a malicious cavill from the aequivocation or double mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Phraſe: for to <hi>render double</hi> unto Antichriſt <hi>according to his workes,</hi> is
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:96676:257"/>not to recompence his wickedneſſe with twice as much wickedneſſe (for the heavenly voice cannot command ſin) but to inflict double puniſhment on him. For the works of Antichriſt, wherwith he afflicts the godly, in reſpect indeed of himſelfe are moſt vile ſins: but in reſpect of the godly afflicted by him, they are but ſorrowes and torments, which only they are commanded to double to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt: for thus God himſelfe interpreteth it, ver. 7. <hi>how much ſhe hath glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied herſelfe, and lived deliciouſly: ſo much ſorrow and TORMENT give her.</hi>

Thus I rather take it, becauſe of that which followes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. <hi>ver.</hi> 1.</p>
                     <p>By the name of <hi>Apoſtles and Prophets</hi> are meant the ſoules of the holy Martyrs ſlaine by the <hi>Romane Tyrants,</hi> and <hi>Antichriſt</hi> for profeſſing the doctrine of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Prophets: which we may gather from ver. 24. <hi>In her is found the blood of the Prophets:</hi> and yet we read not that any of the old Prophets were ſlaine at <hi>Rome:</hi> which I mention becauſe of <hi>Riberas</hi> ſtarting-hole on <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. verſe 8. where he denies that <hi>Papall Rome</hi> is Babylon, becauſe not Popiſh but Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Rome killed the Apoſtles Peter and Paul, <hi>but in vaine</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhould the Apoſtles and Prophets be commanded to rejoyce over the vengeance of Popiſh Rome, by

                     <p>The ſoules therefore of the ancient and latter Martyrs to whom (requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God to avenge them before the time, were given <hi>White robes,</hi> that they might in the meane while reſt content with their felicity) are now at length bid to rejoyce, becauſe the time of vengeance is at hand. <hi>yea,</hi> becauſe God had now avenged their blood, and abundantly anſwered their deſire.</p>
                     <p>This cauſe of joy is added: <hi>For God hath avenged you on her</hi>] In the Greeke the Hebraiſme is very Emphaticall: <hi>Becauſe God hath judged your judgement on her:</hi> For both the cauſe of their Martyrdome is approved: that it was a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is, righteous and pleaſing to God: as alſo the puniſhment of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon is wholly attributed to God the Iudge, and the avengement of the innocent blood of the Saints is made the moſt righteous cauſe thereof.</p>
                     <p>But he ſeems to command rejoycing over evill; not in the leaſt: But bids them to rejoyce, becauſe the riot and tyrannie of Babylon is repreſſed, and the Church freed from the ſame: as alſo becauſe Gods glorie is vindicated from the blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the ungodly. Now the deliverance of the Church, the ſuppreſſing of the wicked, the vindicating of Gods glorie, and Declaration of Gods righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in puniſhing the ungodly, are not evill things, but excellent and the moſt juſt judgements of the Lord. So that the Heavenly Inhabitants are bid to rejoyce not over evill but good things. And this is the meaning,

                     </p>
                     <p>Whence it appeareth, that this rejoycing of the Godly is oppoſed to two weightie Tentations: I. Leaſt it might bee thought Godlineſſe ſhould want its fruit. II. Leaſt the Godly might ſeeme to be quite forſaken of God under the Croſſe.</p>
                     <p>If therefore thou object. To rejoyce over anothers harme <hi>is prohibited other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: but here the Saints are bid to rejoyce over other mens harmes: Therefore they are commanded to doe that which is forbidden in other places:</hi> The Aſſumption is falſe: Or there are four <hi>termes:</hi> for to rejoyce over evils, as they are evils and torments, not as they are a righteous avengement, and an illuſtration of Gods glory, is forbidden in Scripture.</p>

                     <p>2. <hi>For true and righteous are his judgements, for hee hath judged the great whore; which did corrupt the Earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his ſervants at her hand.</hi>

                     <p>They who ſay in the <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> that the ruine of Babylon ſhall affoard unto the Saints a moſt delightfull argument of rejoycing and praiſing God: and in the <hi>Theſis,</hi> that the Saints, however they bee many times offended in regard of the proſperity of the wicked in this life, and complaine as if God dealt hardly with them; yet at length they ſhall perfectly know, and openly confeſſe, that the Iudgements of God are true and righteous in the whole government of the world: They draw indeed a true and profitable doctrine from this place, which is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of obſervation. Notwithſtanding in my opinion they doe not ſufficiently touch the occaſion and cauſe of the renewing of the Viſion by this <hi>Chore</hi> or Company.</p>
                     <p>The occaſion indeed <hi>Gagnaeus</hi> and <hi>Brightman</hi> do rightlie obſerve in their notes,
<note place="margin">The occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing</note> from <hi>ver.</hi> 20. <hi>Chap.</hi> 18. where the Angell exhorted the Saints to rejoyce over the judgement of Babylon: <hi>Rejoyce over her thou Heaven, and ye holy Apostles, &amp;c.</hi> whereupon Heaven and all the Saints do now rejoyce, and joyfully applaud the Iudgement of God.</p>
                     <p>But what is the reaſon that not here onely, but formerly alſo the Company of Rejoycers are ſo often brought in?

                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> that this is no wiſh by which the glorifyed Saints and Angels pray that
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:96676:264"/>God might obteine theſe good things, as if he had them not: for he is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>The God of ſufficiencie,</hi> poſſeſſing all ſalvation, glory, honour, and power in himſelf, and abundantly powring the ſame forth on his creatures: But it is a confeſſion of praiſe, in which the ſaints of heaven celebrate and profeſſe that God hath all theſe good things, and that all creatures ought to aſcribe the ſame to God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The ſecond,</hi> that this rejoycing over <hi>Babylons deſtruction,</hi> is not <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> a rejoycing in evill. For they rejoyce not over the afliction and torments of the <hi>whore,</hi> which were contrarie to charity: but that the glory of God is vindicated from her blaſphemies, the which is very good.</p>
                     <p>Wee therefore, after the example of this multitude, ought to aſcribe our ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; all honour, glory and power to the Lord our God, that is, with all our hearts and ſoules to bleſſe the Lord for his incomprehenſible mercies unto us in Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Becauſe true and righteous are his judgements,]</hi> This cauſe of the ſaints rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ſhewes more clearely what I erewhile ſaid, that they inſult not over the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the wicked out of an evill affection, but are wholy bent in celebrating the righteouſneſſe and glory of God. The firſt cauſe, that the judgements are true and righteous, is generall and before expounded on Chap. 16. v. 7. and Chap. 15. v. 4. The wicked under their puniſhments like dogs barke againſt God, as if he were a tyrant. The ſaints on the contrary ſilence their blaſphemous mouthes by confeſſing that the Lord in puniſhing of them is not tyrannicall in the leaſt, but a moſt righteous Iudge. For it is juſt to give every one his own: but in order of juſtice puniſhment for wickedneſſe is due to the ungodly. When therefore God puniſheth them, his judgements are righteous.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And true]</hi> that is, certainely to be accompliſhed: for though God doth a long while delay the puniſhments threatned againſt the wicked, yet at length he truly executes the ſame. So Pſal. 9 v. 9. <hi>Jehovah judgeth the world in righteouſneſſe, he mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters judgement to the people in uprightneſſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For he hath judged the great whore]</hi> Specially they celebrate two examples of Gods righteouſneſſe, as it were the neereſt matter of their joy: the condemnation of the <hi>great whore,</hi> and the vindicating of the ſervants of God. Both being mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly worthy to be celebrated. For that <hi>Great whore</hi> hath corrupted the earth by her fornication. Now what is more agreeable to juſtice, then that ſuch a <hi>peſt</hi> which hath defiled the inhabitants of the earth with her moſt filthy whoredome, ſhould be adjudged unto eternall damnation. <hi>Moreover</hi> with her <hi>hand,</hi> that is tyranical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with fire and ſword ſhe hath oppreſſed, &amp; killed the ſervants of God. Now it is a righteous thing to avenge the innocent blood, and ſuch as are uniuſtly oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. But God hath avenged the blood of his ſervants on the whore, by rendring unto her ſuch like puniſhments, as ſhe had before exerciſed. For the deſtruction of the adverſaries is the vindicating of the Saints. Furthermore who this <hi>great whore</hi> is, what her whoredoms, what earth, and how ſhe hath corrupted the ſame: need not on this place to be repeated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Let us learne</hi> to acknowledge and celebrate Gods righteous judgements in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the adverſaries: And continuallie labour to walk with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, intreating the Lord that the like judgements fal not upon us.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>And again they ſaid]</hi> They conclude the thankeſgiving by repeating the exhortation of <hi>Halleluiah,</hi> to teſtifie the greatneſſe of their joy. They adde further.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And her ſmoake]</hi> AND, hath here an adverſative ſenſe: as if he had ſaid: <hi>Yee praiſe God:</hi> But the <hi>whore</hi> ſhall burne for ever and Ever. <hi>Ribera</hi> interpreteth the <hi>ſmoake</hi> more coldly <hi>of the remembrance of the burning, which</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is alwaies to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, and ſhall never be forgotten.</hi> But they amplifie Gods judgement on the <hi>whore,</hi> becauſe the <hi>ſmoake of her burning and torment ſhall have no end</hi> but remaine for ever, from Chap. 14. v. 11. <hi>And the ſmoak of their torment ſhall aſcend up for ever and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> ſignifying the everlaſting torments that attend Antichriſt and his followers in
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:96676:265"/>hell fire: If perhaps the miſerable Romaniſts by feare thereof might bee deterred from their Idolatrie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Roſe up for ever]</hi> The preſent flame of her burning which they ſhall ſee with their eyes, yeelds matter of joy. Now the <hi>ſmoake aſcendeth up.</hi> Therefore Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylons condition is altogether deplorable.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 <hi>And the foure and twentie Elders]</hi> The former <hi>Chore</hi> deſiſting, another comes in, ſinging, that ſo God might be praiſed with a moſt ſacred Symphonie of all the heavenly dwellers. This was the company of <hi>Elders and Beaſts</hi> often before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Chap. 4.14. and Chap. 5.8. and Chap. 7. 11. and 11. 16. Here they ſerve as it were for a heavenly ſenate (reverend in gravitie and majeſty) unto the former promiſcuous multitude of the heavenly inhabitants, whoſe joy, and celebration of Gods judgements they approue of by their moſt grave acclamation, cloſing up, and as it were ſealing the ſame in two words, <hi>Amen, Halleluiah:</hi> as if they ſhould ſay, It is ſo, as ye have before ſung: ſalvation and glory is truely due to our God: His judgements are truely righteous: Iuſt indeed is the condemnation of the <hi>whore,</hi> and the vindicating of the innocent blood of the ſaints: for <hi>Amen</hi> with the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews is a particle confirming the truth, and ſignifies, <hi>Truely, certainly.</hi> God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is to be truely celebrated with praiſes.</p>
                     <p>Now who theſe <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Beaſts</hi> are, hath been largely declared on Chap. 4. and Chap. 5. The <hi>Elders</hi> repreſented the Company or <hi>Chore</hi> of Patriarchs and Prophets: The <hi>Beaſts</hi> the Apoſtles: although (as hath bin before ſhewed) theſe may alſo be underſtood of the ſtationary Angels before the throne of God. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they bee, certaine it is, they are a more honourable company of the Church triumphant.
<note place="margin">what the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration of the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants is.</note> For the <hi>Elders</hi> weare golden crownes on their heads, and are clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in white raiment, holding harpes and golden vials in their hands, &amp;c. And they ſit upon foure and twenty thrones, being as it were honorable adminiſtrators of the judgements and counſels of God: But for reverence ſake in this ſolemne aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie they fall downe from their thrones on their faces, before the feete of the divine Majeſty, caſting off undoubtedly their crowns alſo (as before Chap. 4.10.) and religiouſly worſhip and adore God, togither with the <hi>Beasts.</hi> This adoration was an admiration of the powers of God, a celebration of his judgments and workes, a ready publiſhing of his mercies, and laſtly a teſtimony of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſubjection. In which they afford us an example of religious worſhip and thankeſgiving. For if the Saintes in heaven who are come to their journeyes end praiſe God inceſſantly: how much more ought wee poore traveillers to worſhip the Lord without intermiſſion. Neither doe they adore one another, but God <hi>ſitting on the throne.</hi> And therefore ſuch as direct their worſhip unto <hi>others,</hi> ſhall never come to this <hi>Chore:</hi> of which thing the Angell will by and by inſtruct us.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 <hi>And a voyce came out of the throne]</hi> Both companies had finiſhed their <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leluiah:</hi> notwithſtanding the ſong of praiſes was not as yet ended. Therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>Chore</hi> is invited unto a new gratulation, by another voyce.</p>
                     <p>A new voice <hi>out of the throne]</hi> not of God ſitting on the throne, as before Chap. 14.13. <hi>A voyce from heaven:</hi> and Chap. 16.17. <hi>A voyce out of the Temple.</hi> The author of this voyce is not ſhewed, being uncertaine: yet we may eaſily gather, that it was divine, becauſe it <hi>proceeds out of the throne:</hi> yet not of God ſitting, but of the Lambe ſtanding on the throne: becauſe he ſaith: <hi>Praiſe our God.</hi> Now Chriſt acknowledged God to be his and ours: becauſe he is the <hi>Lamb</hi> and Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, as if he ſhould ſay, The prayſes of God, touching his righteous judgements, are not yet ended: There remaine other works and benefits farre exceeding theſe judgements to be celebrated. What theſe are, the following Hymne ſhall teach us. Now whom doth he invite?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>All ye his ſervants]</hi> The ſervants of God are all that are and ſhall be ſaved: both Angels &amp; men: For alſo the good Angels are preſerved by grace in their integrity, &amp; hence throughout the Scripturs they are named the <hi>ſervants of God,</hi> as being ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits moſt ready to execute the miniſtries of God. But as for men, they are Gods
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:96676:265"/>ſervants, both ſuch who continually ſerve him with praiſes in heaven, viz the ſaints triumphing with Chriſt: <hi>as alſo</hi> who yet are here on earth ſerving him with ſeare in faith and true piety <hi>viz.</hi> all the Elect and faithfull of the Church militant here below. Whereas therefore the heavenly Herauld doth ſtir up in <hi>generall</hi> all the ſervants of God to praiſe him, and in <hi>ſpeciall</hi> all his fearers, he ſheweth, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God is to be celebrated by the companies of the heavenly inhabitants apart, but with ioynt wiſhes and voyces of all Gods ſervants together, as wel of Angels, as men, as wel of the Saints triumphant in heaven, as of the militant on earth, that is, by the vniverſall conſent or accord of the whole Catholick Church: This expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not obſcurely confirmed by the Vniverſal particle <hi>All ye his ſervants,</hi> No one therefore of Gods ſervants is to be ſilent. The diſtribution alſo prooves the ſame <hi>ſmall and great</hi>] Therefore both children and old men, men and Angels are invited to this duty of prayſe.</p>
                     <p>Hence now may eaſily be underſtood, what is meant by that <hi>great multitude,</hi> whoſe loud and terrible ſound Iohn did erewhile hear. Moreover we ſee this voyce belongs to us alſo. For if God be our God, we muſt wholie imploy our ſelves in his ſervice, we muſt not be the ſervants of men, and ſlaves of ſinne: but if we be Gods ſervants, him we muſt feare above all things and onely worſhip. If we feare God then let us joyne our ſelves to this Chore, and gladly celebrate the Lord with all his ſervants.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 <hi>And I heard as it were a voyce]</hi> Behold the eſſicacie of the heavenly voyce, the willing obedience of Gods ſervants: being commanded to prayſe the Lord, they all readily lift up their voyce to his praiſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Of a great multitude]</hi> The old verſion corruptly renders it <hi>a great Trumpet.</hi> This great multitude, is the Vniverſall Church of Gods ſervants in heaven and earth: as we ſee by the voice comming out of the throne. Therefore this voyce &amp; accord is great, divers, and weighty, as it were of many waters, running ſwiftly through un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>even places (ſo as a man cannot heare himſelfe ſpeake) or of many <hi>thunders</hi> with whoſe eccho heaven and earth is filled.</p>
                     <p>Thus the holy Ghoſt aggravates this voyce, not that it was terrible (ſaue to the ungodly) but ſo vehement and weightie, that the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and <hi>Dragon</hi> with all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators might, yea were forced to hear the ſame. By ſuch like <hi>metaphors</hi> the voice of the 144000 <hi>ſealed ones</hi> is amplified Chap. 14. 2. See the expoſition on that place. And they are taken out of Ierem. 51.55.
<note place="margin">This ſong of prayſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the laſt times.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now it will appeare from the following <hi>Hymne,</hi> that this whole <hi>prayſing ſong</hi> belonges to the laſt times, not long before Chriſts comming to judgement: in which undoubtedly we now live: and therefore we are bound to joyn our voyce with the ſame: the Church triumphant ſings in heaven: &amp; the church militant hath with joynt deſires almoſt theſe hundred yeers (ſince which the Church began to be purged from the dregs of Antichriſt) ſung, &amp; praiſed the Lord, becauſe he hath ſet up among us the kingdome of his Son, and freed us from the tyranny of Popery, intreating him at length to deliver that <hi>great whore</hi> to condemnation, and avenge the blood of his ſervants on her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Halleluiah for the Lord reigneth]</hi> They begin the hymne as before, with <hi>Halleluiah:</hi> But the argumentes of their joy are more magnificent then before: And they are two. One properly concernes the glorie of God: the other of the Church. Of the former they ſay: <hi>Becauſe the Lord God omnipotent hath reignea]</hi> that is, hath now at length declared that he is truely king omnipotent.</p>
                     <p>God indeed alwaies reigneth,
<note place="margin">How God now reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and is to reign af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward.</note> and did never ceaſe governing the world and Church. But now his kingdome is obſcure becauſe of Antichriſt and wicked mens cruelty: who hitherto have as it were without puniſhment tumultuouſly raged in his kingdome. But at length God ſhall reigne alone and manifeſtly, having ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued all adverſaries and aboliſhed all powers in this life. Then he ſhall be ſaid <hi>truely to reigne,</hi> when he ſhall appeare ſo to reigne, as that in regard of his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glory, he ſeemed not to have reigned before. For many things are then ſaid to bee, when they begin to be manifeſted. Therefore he is ſaid then to reign, not
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:96676:266"/>according to the eſſence, but forme of his kingdome, in which reſpect alſo Paul ſaith 1. Cor. 15. <hi>That then Chriſt is to deliver up the Kingdome to God his Father.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Let us bee glad and rejoyce</hi>] By another more effectuall argument, they ſtirre up to gladneſſe and prayſing of God, from the circumſtance of time. At joyfull times we are to rejoyce: But weddings are times of gladnes, then the bridegroom, and the bride with great applauſe of kindred and friends goe to embrace each other.</p>
                     <p>But leaſt they might ſeeme to rejoyce for their owne good onely, they adde, <hi>And let us give honour to God</hi>] Not by conferring on him that which he hath not, but by acknowledging, and celebrating his infinite juſtice and power in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wicked, his goodneſſe and mercy in vindicating his ſervants, the which he hath from, and by himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>So that they ſhew unto us the fountaine and manner of true rejoycing in God: For then we truely rejoyce, when we give honour to God, when we acknowledg and confeſſe with a willing mind, that God is the author of that good we enjoy: ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>I rejoyced greatly in the Lord,</hi> Philip. 4.10. and bids us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the Lord our God, that is, to attribute the glory of all good to God. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto the exhortation. Now let us conſider the reaſon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Becauſe the marriage of the Lambe is come</hi>] The <hi>Lamb</hi> is Chriſt, as before we ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: His wedding or marriage, is the ſolemne and moſt joyfull copulation of the bride and bridegroom. Chriſt is the bridegroom, ſo he calleth himſelf Marc. 2. 19.20.
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Ephe</hi> 5.27.26.</note> and ſo the <hi>Baptist</hi> cals him, Iohn 3.29. But who is the bride? The holy Catholick Church 2. Cor. 11.2. Epheſ. 5.26. whom Chriſt hath eſpouſed by <hi>giving himſelfe a ranſome for her, ſanctifying and cleanſing her with the waſhing of water, by the word, to preſent her to himſelfe a glorious Church, not having ſpot, or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing,</hi> &amp;c? According to the promiſe: <hi>I will betroth thee unto mee for ever in righteouſneſſe,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2.19.</note> and in judgement, and in loving kindneſſe, and in mercies: J will even betroth thee unto mee in faithfulneſſe, and thou ſhalt know the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now although this betrothing between Chriſt and the Church be in this life, ſo that wee are Chriſts, and Chriſt ours, and dwels by faith in our hearts: neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the marriage is not yet. Now is the eſpouſal time, the marriage being differred to the end of the world. For the <hi>bridegroom</hi> is yet as it were in a farre countrey, viz. in the heavens: neither is the <hi>bride</hi> as yet prepared: becauſe all the Elect that are to be gathered, are not yet gathered: Therefore the time of joy is not yet come: But the marriage ſhallbe in the end of the world: for then the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom ſhall returne, and the Bride ſhalbe prepared in her perfect beautie, for the embracing of her bridegroom: and then ſhalbe the time of perfect joy. Then all Gods ſervants and all his fearers, both ſmall and great ſhall ſing together, <hi>Let us be glad, and rejoyce, and give honourto him, for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made her ſelfe ready.</hi> This marriage in one word denotes the full and finall redemption and glorification of the Churchof the Elect with Chriſt in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The marriage is come</hi>] For, is neer or at hand. Therefore this voyce belongs to the Church of the laſt times, in which we are, and therfore we are ſtirred up to glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that with joyfullneſſe we may meet our bridegroom, who is comming unto us.</p>
                     <p>They adde: <hi>And his wife hath made her ſelfe ready</hi>] This is ſpoken after the manner of men: For the marriage day being come, the bride prepareth and ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth her ſelfe with nuptiall ornaments, that in her full beautie ſhe may be brought to the embracing of her bridegroom. They call her, <hi>wife,</hi> for bride, becauſe of the neereneſſe of marriage: For now indeed ſo long as ſhe remaines in the world, ſhe is but <hi>hetrothed:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">How the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſed and wife differs.</note> but then ſhe ſhall be the <hi>wife,</hi> when ſhe is brought unto the heavenly houſe of her bridegroom. For the betrothed bride is one not yet deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over to the bridegroome, but remaining at her owne houſe: but the wife is delivered and goeth into the houſe of the bridegroom. Or the word <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="481" facs="tcp:96676:266"/>maiden, or married wife, as mat. 1.20. &amp; Chap. 19. v. 3.5.8.9. &amp; 22. v. 24.25. and Luk. 14.20. The which I note becauſe of the place, 1. Corin. 9.5. <hi>have we not power to lead about a ſiſter</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Hath prepared her ſelfe</hi>] This favours not the Palagian ſtrength &amp; preparation of free-will. For it preſently followeth, <hi>And it was given or</hi> granted <hi>her, that ſhee ſhould be arayed in fine linnen,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore the ornament of the ſpouſe is freely given by the bridegroome: ſo that ſhee hath it not of her ſelfe: Neither doth the <hi>Text</hi> ſpeake of preparation to grace, but to glory: Now ſhe prepares her ſelfe by grace, prepared, or granted her of Chriſt her bridegroom. For the bride receiveth her ornament from the bridegroome, as it is ſaid: <hi>Hee ſanctifyed her with the waſhing of water, by the word, that he might preſent her to himſelf, &amp;c.</hi> And,

The multitude therefore thus ſpeake, to teach the duty of the bride, what ſhee ought to do, and doth al the time of her eſpouſall: To wit, ſhe muſt &amp; doth make her ſelfe ready for her marriage at hand. Like as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If a man purge himſelfe from theſe, he ſhall be a veſſell unto honour.</hi> And: <hi>Let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the fleſh and Spirit.</hi>

                     <p>Before we goe forward, <hi>Alcaſars</hi> impudent fiction is to be refuted, who would obtrude to us the <hi>Babyloniſh ſtrumpet</hi> inſtead of Chriſts ſpouſe, eagerly contending, that this <hi>wife of the Lambe,</hi> can be no other, ſave the <hi>Romane Church.</hi> And why?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt, this place alludes,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>unto the hiſtory of Heſter, who alone, among many <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgins became wife to Ahaſuerus.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly, ſhe is the wife of the Lamb,

                     <p>

But onely the Romiſh Church is that Queen. Therefore the Church of Rome onely is wife of the Lamb.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Who can withhold laughter at ſuch childiſh fopperies?</p>
                     <p>The firſt alluſion is feined, and were it granted, yet the <hi>aſſumption</hi> is falſe, viz. that the Romane Church is that, which <hi>Heſter</hi> was.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>ſecond,</hi> he goes altogether from the matter. For to rule the nations with a rod of iron, is promiſed to every one that overcommeth, Rev. 2.27. But the <hi>iron rod</hi> with which the <hi>Pope</hi> ſmiteth, not the nations, but all Churches, he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the <hi>dragon</hi> who gave his power and throne to the <hi>beaſt,</hi> Rev. 13.2.</p>
                     <p>In the third, he againe feineth an alluſion, which is not: and if it were, yet could it not beare ſuch a ſence, which this flatterer would hence draw by feined alluſions.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore to his fopperies we oppoſe a true and ſolid demonſtration, which he hath framed againſt himſelfe, not being able to take away the difficultie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. viz.

                     </p>
                     <p>Shee is the wife and bride of the Lamb, whom the Lamb hath redeemed to himſelf, waſhed and ſanctifyed in his own blood, Ephe. 5.16. Rev. 1.5. and to whom he gives life eternall, Iohn. 10.28. But this onely is the whole Catholick Church of the firſt borne, Act. 20.28. Hebr. 12.23. Therfore ſhe only is the <hi>wife &amp; bride of the Lamb.</hi> Morover the bride &amp; wiſe of the Lamb is no harlot, but the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> that now is, is <hi>the great whore,</hi> ſiting on the beaſt (as before we heard) who daily commits whordome with her idols and graven images. Therefore ſhe is not the Lambs bride and wiſe, but is groſlie deceived by this Sycophant. Now we goe forward.</p>

                     <p>Touching this fact of the Apoſtle, it may be demanded: Why now he would worſhip the Angel, and not before? with what kind of worſhip? and whether rightlie?</p>
                     <p>Some ſay, it was becauſe he knew him to bee greater then himſelf: but this is no ſatiſfactorie anſwer: For not every one excelling others, is to be worſhipped: Iohn knew that the Elders, &amp; diverſe Angels before ſpoken of, were greater then himſelf, and yet he fell not downe to worſhip them.

                     <p>It was no civil kind of adoration (as we read that <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> civillie worſhipped Angels,

Thus <hi>Auſtin,</hi> whom they would make their Patron, openly refutes them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly, Riberas</hi> fiction is falſe, that <hi>Iohn</hi> would have worſhipped the Angel, with the worſhip of <hi>Douleia</hi> only: For ſo from their <hi>Hypothoſis</hi> he ought not to have bin reprooved: Beſides this fooliſh gloſſe is contradicted by the commandement of the Angel: <hi>Worſhip God:</hi> For the worſhip Iohn would have rendred to him, he commandeth to aſcribe the ſame to God, But he commandeth to render to God the worſhip of <hi>Latreia:</hi> Therefore Iohn would have rendred that to the Angel.</p>
                     <p>But granting the thing which <hi>Ribera</hi> would have, yet the <hi>worſhip of Angels</hi> is thereby overthrowne. For they themſelves denie that <hi>Latreia</hi> is to be rendred to Angels, Now <hi>Duleia</hi> the Angel refuſeth by his owne ſuppoſition. Therefore neither the <hi>worſhip of Latreia,</hi> nor of <hi>Duleia</hi> is due to Angels. Moreover the cauſe <hi>Ribera</hi> feineth of the Angels refuſal, is falſe and frivolous. Falſe: becauſe the Angel makes his owne perſon, not the reverence of Chriſt, the reaſon thereof, <hi>I am thy fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſervant.</hi> It is alſo <hi>frivolous:</hi> For ſo the Angel ought to have worſhipped Iohn, that he might honour Chriſt in his Miniſter or ſervant. But the Angll was not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that he alſo was Chriſts Miniſter, and indeed greater then Iohn, as ſhall appeare Chap. 22. Therefore he ought not to have refuſed this worſhip, that in him Chriſt might have been honoured. Behold what ſhifts idolaters are put too,
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:96676:269"/>and how they are enſnared by themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Now whether Iohn did well or not,
<note place="margin">Whether Iohn did well in worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Angel.</note> is no great queſtion: <hi>Rightly</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ribera</hi>) <hi>he adoreth the meſſenger of the most High God, declaring moſt joyful things unto him:</hi> But this is falſe: becauſe not Gods neſſenger, but God himſelfe muſt be adored: otherwiſe all the Ieſuites, who call themſelves meſſengers of the moſt High God, and companions of Ieſus, ought religiouſly to be worſhipped by us, and ſo much perhaps they deſire. But the Angel forbids the thing: Therefore Iohn did erre, either through humane frailtie, or by miſtaking the perſon. Otherwiſe the Angel ſhould have reprooved him vnjuſtly: For that which is rightly done, is unjuſtly reprooved: And therefore <hi>Bellarmin</hi> contradicts himſelf, in affirming ſo boldlie:

                        <hi>That Angels in reſpect of themſelves are to be worſhipped, and yet they doe well in refuſing to be worſhipped,</hi> This <hi>Italian</hi> ſuppoſeth that they may ſport with Angels in religious worſhip, as they uſe to doe in their complements, where one ſervilely bowing himſelf, is ambitiouſly reſtrained by the other: And thus alſo <hi>Alcaſar</hi> the ſpaniard toyeth.</p>

Therefore the Angel refuſeth the honour of worſhip ſimply, whether we reſpect the kind of honour, or Iohns intention. For the honour was unlawfull: becauſe no religious worſhip is due to the creature, but onely to God: Iohns intention alſo was erronious: for he erred either in the fact or in the perſon, intending to worſhip him, whom he might not, or thinking him to be, who he was not.

                        <hi>I am thy fellow ſervant</hi>] The reaſons why the Angel refuſeth this ſtrange honour, are two. <hi>The firſt</hi> is taken from his perſon, <hi>I am thy fellow ſervant, and of thy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:</hi> as if he had ſaid: It is no way lawfull to worſhip fellow ſervants: becauſe hereby we ſhould make our ſelves ſervants of ſervants. But the Angels are our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſervants. Therefore it is not lawfull to worſhip Angels.</p>
                     <p>This argument of the Angel cannot by any deſtinction of worſhip be ſhifted of in the leaſt. For the <hi>Sophiſters</hi> themſelves confeſſe that the worſhip of <hi>Latreia</hi> is not to be rendred to Angels: neither doth the worſhip of <hi>Duleia,</hi> by the Angels reaſoning belong to them: becauſe they are our <hi>fellow ſervants:</hi> the which <hi>Pereſius</hi> a Popiſh writer (<hi>De tradit. Part.</hi> 3. <hi>Conſid.</hi> 7,) hath well obſerved. Now they are our <hi>fellow ſervants,</hi> becauſe they ſerve with us, the ſame Lord, who is God and Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And of thy brethren</hi>] The reſt of the Apoſtles and miniſters of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That haue the teſtimony of Ieſus</hi>] For, who preach the Goſpel revealed by Ieſus Chriſt. The phraſe ſhewes, that the Evangeliſt Iohn was the writer of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, who familiarlie cals the Goſpel, <hi>the teſtimony of Ieſus,</hi> as we have obſerved before.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Worſhip God</hi>] The ſecond reaſon is taken from that which is proper to God. <hi>The proper worſhip of God, is not agreeable to Angels, but God alone. But all religious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

Therefore it belongs not to mee, but to God alone.</hi> Let Popiſh ſophiſters ſtudie what they can, they ſhall never avoyd the Angels argument, vnleſſe they ſay: Either that the Angels are more ambitious now adayes, then this Angel was: Or they muſt obtrude on them againſt their wils ſtrange worſhip, and make them ſacrilegious ſupplanters.

                           <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd I ſaw heaven opened</hi>] Thus farre of what Iohn heard and did, Now what he ſaw, remains to be treated of, being the <hi>fourth Act</hi> of the <hi>Laſt viſion</hi> ſave one: In which is repreſented Chriſt the Iudge, under the type of a glorious captain coming with a great army from heaven,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Here is pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ved that the laſt judg ement is diſcribed in this place</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.8.</note> againſt the forces of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and the <hi>kings of the earth gathered together in Harmageddon,</hi> before ſpoken of in Chap. 16.16. And I ſee no reaſon why any ſhould doubt that the laſt judgement is here deſcribed: For it is certaine by the teſtimony of the Apoſtle, that Antichriſt ſhall not be conſumed but by the <hi>brightneſſe of Chriſts comming</hi> in the end of the world. But here the glorious comming of Chriſt, and the deſtruction of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt is evidently prefigured. Adde to this, that the preſent <hi>viſion</hi> is cloſed up in this type, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> as it were, by the laſt Act. For the following viſion is new &amp; altogether diverſe from this. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> But all the former viſions (the firſt excepted, which was ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al) had this common, that they ended in the laſt judgement, as we clearely ſhewed in every one of them: Therefore we may not doubt but the ſame thing is here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented alſo.</p>
                     <p>Neither doth <hi>Ribera</hi> deny this, if his words be well weighed. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he feineth, that here is deſcribed I know not what for an inviſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention of Chriſt from heaven before the laſt judgement, to ſuccour the ſaintes wreſtling and ſtriving with Antichriſt and his miniſters. But what is his reaſon? <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Antichriſt ſhall not then be in the laſt judgement:</hi> But this is falſe and againſt that of the Apoſtle even now alledged. For Antichriſt ſhall be deſtroyed by the laſt comming of Chriſt:
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.8.</note> Therefore he ſhall remaine till then. Now <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beras</hi> fiction depends upon another, <hi>viz</hi> that Antichriſt ſhall be killed <hi>fourty five dayes</hi> before the day of judgement, which we have before refuted, beſides it is manifeſtly repugnant to the ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>But of that day and houre no man knoweth, no not the Angels:</hi> The which <hi>Ribera</hi> acknowledgeth in the following Chapter, v, 8. and thereby not unwittingly rejects the fiction of 45 <hi>dayes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſaid <hi>Ribera</hi> doth here alſo not obſcurely confirme our opinion, namely, that this comming of Chriſt proves that which before the heavenly <hi>chore</hi> had ſaid: <hi>For the marriage of the Lamb is come:</hi> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Now the marriage ſhal not be til the end of the world, and full accompliſhment of the puniſhments of the wicked. But here he commeth to be avenged on the adverſaries: Therefore this ſhall be Chriſts laſt comming, in which both his enemies ſhall be aboliſhed, and the <hi>marriage of the Lambe</hi> celebrated. For the adverſaries deſtruction and the Saints glorification ſhall be both together.</p>
                     <p>To this <hi>Laſt Act</hi> therefore of the <hi>ſixt viſion,</hi> doth anſwer (in way of Parrallel) the <hi>Laſt Act</hi> of the <hi>third viſion</hi> in the end of Chap. 11. and the <hi>Laſt Act</hi> of the <hi>fourth viſion</hi> in the end of Chap. 14. touching the <hi>harveſt</hi> and <hi>vintage:</hi> and laſtly, the <hi>laſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iall</hi> of the <hi>fift viſion</hi> in the end of Chap. 16. For this <hi>Act</hi> doth cohere with the hiſtory of the <hi>ſixt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iall,</hi> touching the <hi>kings of the earth gathered together in Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mageddon to the battle of that Great day of God Almighty:</hi> the which battle was there broken off by the laſt voice <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>It is done:</hi> and is here at length repreſented,</p>
                     <p>Whence we haue a fourth argument for our opinion: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> for that <hi>great day of God Almighty,</hi> ſhall be no other but the day of judgement, Whatever <hi>Ribera</hi> feineth to the contrary in Chap. 16. Num. 11. For the <hi>ſeventh plague</hi> ſhall not be powred forth before the day of judgement (as he pretendeth) but in the very day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and conſummation of all things: But this battle ſhall be in that great day of God Almighty. Therefore this battle ſhall be in the laſt day of judgement.</p>
                     <p>Which things thus laid downe, the hiſtorie of this type is not obſcure. For what we ſhall here ſee touching Chriſts comming from heaven with an army of horſemen to fight againſt the Beaſt and kings of the earth, to take and caſt all of them into the lake of fire and brimſtone, is indeed the very thing which Chriſt
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:96676:270"/>ſaith in the Goſpels.

                        <hi>And then ſhall that wicked one be revealed whom the Lord will conſume with the brightneſſe of his comming.</hi> This, I ſay, ſhalbe that bright day of Chriſts comming: when this glorious Emperour ſhall come from heaven with innumerable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: This ſhall be the deſtruction of <hi>that wicked one,</hi> when the <hi>Beast</hi> (Antichriſt) and his followers ſhall be taken and caſt into the Lake of fire. Now let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both <hi>armies</hi> going forth to battle, with the event thereof.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I ſaw heaven opened</hi>] In this there is no allegorie: But <hi>Iohn</hi> doth hiſtoricallie ſet down what he law <hi>viz, heaven opened</hi> and Chriſt Comming thence with his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Angels, under the likeneſſe of a Captaine and troups of horſemen: as horſemen uſe to ruſh forceably through the gates of a citie, being opened.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And behold a white horſe</hi>] To wit, <hi>Went worth.</hi> The Maieſticall deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the Captaine figureth the glorious comming of Chriſt from heaven, to judge Antichriſt and the ungodly. Therefore we are not to imagine that it is meant of corporall horſes, or horſemen, or ſwords, or any ſuch thing. But under the <hi>allegorie</hi> of military forces, that <hi>brightnes of Chriſts comming</hi> (ſpoken of 2. Theſ. 2.8) is here repreſented. For Generals uſe not to goe on foot, but to be moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on brave horſes, that with facilitie and ſwiftneſſe, they may be here &amp; there in the army to put forward the battle the more hotlie. So Chriſt <hi>ſits on a white-horſe,</hi> by which is ſignifyed the divine majeſty, power and glory of the judge: For the white colour here denotes excellency. Before at the opening of the <hi>firſt ſeale</hi> came forth a <hi>white horſe with his rider &amp;c.</hi> The rider indeed is the ſame both there and here, namely <hi>CHRIST:</hi> but the <hi>white horſe</hi> is diverſe. For the former ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed the <hi>Apoſtolicall Church,</hi> pure and white: on which Chriſt riding obtained the firſt victory over Paganiſme. Here he comes forth on a <hi>white horſe</hi> of majeſty and heavenly glory, to obtaine the laſt victorie over Antichriſt: And that the world might know him to be that <hi>Great Pontife of Rome:</hi> he himſelf cauſeth his God as often as he takes on a journey to be carried on <hi>a white horſe with a ſilver bel,</hi> and to be ſent a day before him with his ſervants and ſcullions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Was called faithfull and true</hi>] The <hi>General</hi> for our conſolation is ſet foorth by diverſe titles illuſtrating his divine Majeſtie and power: Other Generals indeed uſe to goe forth with great warlike furniture: but are ignorant of the event. For it is not in their hands to diſpoſe of the doubtfull ſucceſſe of battles, but inſtead of conquering they are often overcome, or ſlain. But the titles of this Generall do al tend to certifie us that he ſhall undoubtedly and certainely obtaine the victorie, bee the power of the adverſe partie never ſo great.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Faithfull</hi>] In authoriſing and maintaining his forces. <hi>TR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E,</hi> in rendring wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and rewards to ſuch as have fought ſtoutly: This ſentence is enough for the allegorie.

                        <hi>And in righteouſneſſe he doth judge and make warre</hi>] This Captaine comes not onely as a warriour, but alſo as a judg: both offices he adminiſtreth in <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi>
                        <pb n="490" facs="tcp:96676:271"/>that is, righteouſly: He will execute <hi>Judgement</hi> righteouſly: becauſe to the upright he will render the promiſed reward of life and glory, to the wicked the wages of death eternal, according to the declaration of the Goſpel, Rom. 2. v. 6.16.

No man ſhalbe injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſpoiled or hurt by his forces, which otherwiſe is cuſtomarie in warre. The adverſaries onely ſhall ſuffer by this conflict, beeing either ſlain or taken. Which againe is no obſcure argument to proove that here is intended that righteous judgement ſpoken of, Rom. 2.5.</p>

It ſignifies mightie quickneſſe, in ſight and fervencie of this General: The which vigilancie of Chriſt for his Church was before alſo ſet forth. But here it denotes his quicknes in perceiving al things: For he ſhal Iudg even the ſecrets of the heart: It ſignifyes alſo the providence and valour of this warriour, who not onely lookes to the neceſſities of his armie, but knows alſo the hidden plots and counſels of the adverſaries, bringing the ſame to nothing, like as fire conſumes the ſtubble.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And on his head were many crownes</hi>] Our General weares a royall diadem on his head: The Beaſt alſo had <hi>ten crownes on his heades,</hi> or three upon one. But Our Captaine hath many more. And therefore is not leſſe in Dignity, but in Power farre exceeds Antichriſt, his pretended Vicar.</p>

<pb n="491" facs="tcp:96676:271"/>ſhall ſlay the adverſaries with the ſword of his mouth, v. 21.

He comes not unarmed: Nor yet burdened with any weighty kind of armes, as other Generals are uſed to doe with helmets, breſt plates, and coates of male, that their bodies lie not open to the ſtrokes of their adverſaries, holding in their hands ſwords, ſpeares, Iavilins, arrowes, &amp;c. therewithall to ſtrike the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy: This <hi>Captaine</hi> hath onely a <hi>ſword</hi> (very ſharp indeed) not in his hand, but <hi>in his mouth,</hi> which ſhewes that it is no material ſword, which is guided not with the mouth, but the hand.

Hence it is that many interpret this <hi>garment ſprinkled with blood,</hi> of his humanity, according to which he ſhed his blood. But here is intended, not the paſſion, death and blood of Chriſt, but the deſtruction of the adverſaries which he will execute on them at his Laſt comming. The blood therefore, with which he is here ſaid to be <hi>ſprinkled,</hi> is not his owne, but the adverſaries, not indeed as yet, but ſoon after to be ſlaine, yet he is now figured out as if he were alreadie ſprinkled, becauſe of the certainty of the victory. Notwithſtanding chiefly he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in the Metaphor of the wine-preſſe, into which the adverſaries or <hi>cluſters</hi> being caſt, ſhall be troden by him, ſo as his garment ſhall appeare ſtained with their blood: yea, their blood came out of the wine-preſſe, even unto the <hi>horſes bridles, by the ſpace of a thouſand and ſixe hundred furlongs:</hi> ſee, Chap. 14.20.</p>

For this is no obſcure alluſion unto that Hiſtory, as it were unto the type of that horrible puniſhment. Not that the Earth ſhall litterally open her mouth and ſwallow them up (neither doth the Letter ſay ſo) but becauſe Chriſt the Iudge will thruſt them alive (that is, not like other men taken away before by ordinary death) into the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite flames of the burning lake, (as a horrible example to others) before the reſt. For the devill alſo, whom the Earth cannot ſwallow up, ſhall be caſt into the ſame lake of fire and brimſtone, <hi>Chap.</hi> 20.10. wherefore it ſignifies a terrible kind of deſtruction, into which the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and the <hi>Falſe-prophet,</hi> ſhall be caſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their other aſſociates.

                        <hi>Into a lake of fire burning with brimſtone</hi>] A Periphraſis of hell, which afterward in Chap. 21.8. is called the <hi>ſecond death,</hi> that is, <hi>eternall:</hi> He calls it metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically <hi>A Lake of fire:</hi> becauſe as fiſhes in a Lake are invironed with waters, ſo theſe ſhall be covered with infernall fire in the Lake of hell, then which nothing can be thought on more miſerable: yea in the <hi>Lake burning with fire and brimſtone,</hi> that is, unquencheable, as before in Chap. 14.10. with many other like pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: For brimſtone is a moſt durable nouriſher of fire, and much thereof being

After many things he <hi>anſwereth:</hi> that properly he is not to be ſlaine, but to remaine no more among the living, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of all power and joy, and brought to the place of the dead. <hi>The Earth,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall ſuddenly open its mouth for him, and violently he ſhallbe carried alive with his Falſe-prophet by divels unto the fire of hell.</hi>

                     <p>But this Queſtion cannot ſeem great, or difficult, in caſe we rightly conſider the words of the Apoſtle. For he ſaith two things touching the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ANTICHRIST: Neither of which are in the leaſt ſhew repugnant to this place.</p>
                     <p>Firſt he ſaith not: <hi>Whom the Lord will ſlay:</hi> but he ſaith <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>Whom he will conſume with the Spirit of his mouth.</hi> This ſhall be the firſt degree of the deſtruction of Antichriſt and his Kingdome: the which hath beene begun theſe hundred yeers: in which the Lord <hi>by the spirit of his mouth,</hi> that is, by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpell, hath, and yet doth conſume the Papacie more and more: no otherwiſe then the flame by burning diminiſheth and conſumeth the match: For as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſeth,

                        <hi>Ribera</hi> here is frivolous, in underſtanding this properly without a metaphor:

And therefore the Events of this Viſion ſhall not follow, but in time goe before the events of the foregoing Viſion.</p>
                     <p>This is a certaine Argument, that this <hi>Viſion</hi> is diverſe from the former: and is no particular Viſion, which ſupplies the former: and that in the <hi>Viſions</hi> a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuated order of Hiſtory, or Times, is not to be obſerved, as moſt Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters imagine.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore after all other apparitions,
<note place="margin">This laſt Viſion is a recapitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing viſions.</note> this laſt Viſion (as it were in place of a concluſion) is exhibited unto Iohn, in which under new types, and the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull binding, looſing, and condemnation of the <hi>Dragon,</hi> and of the deſcription of the Heavenly Ieruſalem, is ſet forth unto Iohn the entire face of the Church, prefiguring the Hiſtory from the firſt gathering thereof among the Gentiles, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till its laſt glorification in Heaven, not indeed by a vaine repetition of the ſame things, but a moſt profitable revealing of things divers from the former myſteries: <hi>viz.</hi> touching the overthrow of Paganiſme among the Gentiles through the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt, of the tempeſts and diſtractions of the laſt thouſand years: with which (beſides the cruelty of the Beaſt) the Church ſhal be exerciſed, and of the moſt joyfull end of all the calamities of the Church. For touching the <hi>Firſt,</hi> Iohn till now had ſeen nothing: Of the <hi>Second,</hi> he had ſeen ſomewhat, but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely, under the <hi>ſixt Trumpet:</hi> Of the <hi>third</hi> alſo he had heard but very little by one of the foure and twenty Elders, towards the end of the <hi>ſecond Viſion.</hi> Now it was very much for Iohns (and ours) inſtruction and conſolation, that none of theſe things ſhould be hid from him. Therefore, there was weighty reaſons, why after the other Viſions, this alſo at laſt ſhould be exhibited. Thus much briefly touching the Order.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An Angell come downe from Heaven</hi>] This Angell figures out CHRIST, as the adjuncts and effects do prove. For he hath the <hi>Key of the bottomleſſe Pit,</hi> that is, the power of hell and death, which Chriſt before attributes to himſelfe,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gen.</hi> 3:15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.22</note> Chap. 18. ver. 18. and he <hi>bindeth Satan,</hi> which is proper to Chriſt: for hee it is, that <hi>bruiſed the head of the</hi> (old) <hi>Serpent, Who through death deſtroyed him that had the power of death,</hi> that is, the devill: He, I ſay, is that <hi>Stronger, taking the houſe and dividing the ſpoile of the ſtrong armed man:</hi> Neither is it new that Chriſt ſhould be repreſented by an Angell in this REVELATION, as we ſee Chap. 7.2. Chap. 8.3. Chap. 10.1, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But that it ſhould be ſome miniſteriall Angell, who (while Chriſt was ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring on the Croſſe) coming from Heaven, bound the devill in the bottomleſſe Pit, is a fiction of <hi>Ribera's,</hi> contrary to the truth of the Goſpell,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Tob.</hi> 8.3.</note> and is not in the leaſt to be proved by the Apocryphall Hiſtory touching <hi>Raphael,</hi> apprehending the devill, and binding him in the deſarts of <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Iohn therefore ſaw Chriſt in the forme of an Angell, not <hi>falling,</hi> but <hi>deſcending from Heaven,</hi> to wit, by his Incarnation:
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.13.</note> 
                        <hi>Hee that deſcended is the ſame alſo that aſcended. And no man aſcended up to Heaven, but he that came downe from Heaven, even the ſon of man which is in Heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But thou wilt ſay, to what purpoſe was it, that Iohn ſhould ſee the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:96676:277"/>of the Son of God, a thing known and paſt ſome while before? Yea it was to great purpoſe, at leaſt in a word to note the originall of the Authour of ſo great a worke, which then began to be done, and which was to continue a <hi>thouſand yeeres,</hi> that Satan being reſtrained from ſeducing the nations, the fullneſſe of the Gentiles ſhould come into the Church, he therefore ſaw Chriſt deſcending from Heaven, that he ſhould bind Satan, that is, deſtroy the workes of the devill, as other, ſo chiefly that horrible Idolatry and diabolicall worſhippings, by which (Iudea excepted) he had hitherto ſeduced all Nations.</p>
                     <p>This end of the Angels deſcending, and this cauſe of the Dragons binding is plainly declared ver. 3. For if Satan ſhould have been permitted to ſway any longer among the Gentiles: in vaine the Apoſtles had preached the Goſpell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. Therefore <hi>Satan was to be bound,</hi> that is, by the ſingular power of God reſtrained, that he ſhould no longer bewitch the Nations, who by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpell were to be gathered unto the Church of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Now I ſee no reaſon why we ſhould leave ſo cleare and plaine an Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: eſpecially ſeeing ſuch as like not the ſame, alledge nothing more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable or agreeable to the preſent Type. The firſt birth or beginning of the Church gathered of the Iewes and Gentiles, was ſomewhat more manifeſtly ſhewed unto Iohn, under the <hi>Type of a woman in travell,</hi> Chapter 12. unto which the Hiſtory of this Chapter doth much accord, as I touched in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Viſion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Having the Key of the bottomleſſe Pit</hi>] Touching this <hi>Key</hi> and <hi>Pit,</hi> See Chap. 1. ver. 18. and Chap. 9.1.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Key of the bottomleſſe pit</hi> is the power of Hell. This Chriſt hath one way, Antichriſt another way, as was there ſhewed. The Pope hath the ſame by preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rication:
<note place="margin">How chriſt &amp; the Pope have the keyes of the bottomleſſe pit.</note> Chriſt by power given him of the Father. The Pope hath it to open the <hi>Pit of Hell,</hi> and thence to draw out the peſtilent ſmoake of his doctrine, and the helliſh Locuſts. Chriſt hath it to ſhut up the Dragon in the bottomleſſe pit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A great Chaine</hi>] That is long and ſtrong enough, to bind the moſt cruell ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſarie, as the forme of a Dragon Chap. 12.13. ſhewes him to bee. This <hi>Chaine</hi> doth metaphorically denote the omnipotency of Chriſt, and all other meanes by which he hath bound Satan, as his Paſſion, Croſſe, Death, and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, the ſending of the Holy Ghoſt, and chiefly the doctrine of the Goſpell, by the preaching whereof, Chriſt hath as ſtrongly bound Satan, by deſtroying and rooting out Paganiſme among the Gentiles, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting them to the Faith: as when a mightie adverſary is bound by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour with a great chaine.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>And he laid hold on the Dragon</hi>] What is this, but the caſting out of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, and his Angels into the earth by Michael, as in Chap. 12.9? This Angell therefore and <hi>Michael</hi> there ſpoken of, is one, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt, whoſe Victory over Satan was there figured out generally, that he ſhould no more accuſe the Elect in the ſight of God: but here ſpecially, that he ſhould no more ſeduce the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as it is in verſe 3.</p>
                     <p>And that we may certainly know that this <hi>Dragon</hi> is the ſame, whom Michael there did vanquiſh,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>The ſame dragon that is here bound, was overcome in chap.</hi> 12.</note> he is here ſet forth by the ſame Titles: <hi>The old Serpent, the devill, Satan:</hi> the reaſon of which we there expounded. Now this ſo exact a deſcription doth altogether conſtraine us to underſtand here by the <hi>Dragon</hi> none other ſave the devill and Satan. For wherefore ſhould hee be defined with ſo many names which alwayes in Scripture denote the devill, if ſome other adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ought to be underſtood. Therefore in this place I can no more ſubſcribe to Brightman (who will have this <hi>Angell</hi> to be <hi>Constantine,</hi> the <hi>Dragon Maxentius</hi> and <hi>Maximinus,</hi> whom he deſtroyed for the good of the Church) then to <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> interpreting this <hi>Dragon</hi> of the Emperour <hi>Henry V.</hi> being bound with the Chaine of Excommunication by <hi>Pope Calixtus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bound him] This binding,</hi> ſaith ANDREAS, <hi>is the caſting downe of the devill,
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:96676:277"/>which was done by the force of the Lords Paſſion:
<note place="margin">The bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</note> for thereby the power of Satan is bound: a token of which thing was ſeene in the deſtruction and overthrow of the heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Idolatry, the demoliſhing of Idolatrous Temples, the ceaſing of Sacrifices on their Altars, and at length the knowledge and obeying the will of God revealed throughout the whole world:</hi> the ſum is, It is Chriſts victory over Satan, of which mention is made in the Goſpell: <hi>The Prince of this world is judged.
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Io.</hi> 16.11. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.18 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.13</note> I ſaw Satan as lightning fall from Heaven: Now ſhall the Prince of this world be caſt forth.</hi> But the manner of his binding is more exactly expreſſed in the following verſe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>And caſt him into the bottomleſſe Pit</hi>] That is, thruſt him, as it were fettered, into the Infernall Priſon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And ſhut him</hi>] For, <hi>ſhut him up,</hi> locking as it were the <hi>bottomleſſe Pit,</hi> that the <hi>Dragon</hi> might not come forth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And ſet a ſeale upon him</hi>] To wit, on the doore of the <hi>bottomleſſe Pit,</hi> that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhould breake out, or any dare to breake open the priſon before the time: as the Iews ſealed the doore of Chriſts Sepulchre.
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.66. <hi>Dan:</hi> 6.17.</note> And <hi>Darius</hi> with his owne Signet ſealed the Den of Lions, that there might come no deliverance to <hi>Daniel,</hi> ſave onely from God. All theſe things are ſpoken after the manner of men, to ſignifie the fullneſſe of Chriſts victory over Satan, for by his power and dominion Satan is kept as faſt bound, as a Malefactor in Priſon, and ſhackled by the Iudge. An evidence hereof we have often in the Goſpell, where the devils beſeech Chriſt <hi>that he would not ſend them into the bottomleſſe Pit,</hi> or priſon:
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.31</note> but the end which is added, is well to be obſerved</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That he ſhould no more ſeduce the Nation</hi>] To wit, with ſo free and full ſway as formerly he had done. The Particle <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>no more,</hi> is very emphaticall. This is the end for which Chriſt bound Satan, that <hi>he ſhould deceive the Nations no more.</hi> Formerly therefore he had freely ſeduced them: now he is <hi>bound,</hi> or hindred from further ſeducing them, that is, from hindring any longer the faith and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpell unto the Nations.</p>

Thus therefore the Angell hath bound the <hi>Dragon,</hi> Chriſt by his coming over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw Paganiſme, delivered the Gentiles from the ſeduction of Satan, and brought them to the light of the Goſpell and faith of the Church.</p>
                     <p>But it may be demanded: Was not Satan of old thruſt into priſon, and bound with the chaines of darkeneſſe, as it is ſaid, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. &amp; <hi>Jude</hi> ver. 6. Beſides, hath not Satan even after Chriſts coming raged powerfully, and yet doth?</p>
                     <p>Unto the former it is anſwered: that the evill Angels indeed from the time of their firſt Apoſtacie, were adjudged unto the priſon of hell: yet not ſo, but that they might very freely goe abroad to hurt the ſons of men, ſo farre as the judgements of God ſhould permit and ſuffer the ſame. The devill therefore by his free raging in Paganiſme, held as it were his Kingdome among the Gentiles before Chriſts coming, by Gods permiſſion. But now by Chriſts coming from Heaven, Satan is ſaid, by a ſpeciall judgement, to be bound, and thruſt into <hi>the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe Pit,</hi> becauſe Chriſt did chiefly deſtroy his workes and kingdome among the Gentiles, when by the light of the Goſpell he opened the eyes of the blind, that the deceits of Satan being diſcovered and condemned by them, they might give themſelves on to Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Vnto the latter I ſay: That Satan hath very many Emiſſary Angels under him, by whom (howſoever bound himſelfe yet) he is hurtfull to mankind, and to the Church: and ceaſeth not to reigne in the hearts of the children of diſobedience. But the head being bound, what ſhould the ſervants doe? for though God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit theſe to wander abroad the thouſand yeers, notwithſtanding they could not any longer uphold Paganiſme.</p>
                     <p>But thou wilt ſay, In Chap. 12.9. not onely the <hi>Dragon</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>caſt into the Earth by Michael,</hi> Chriſt, but his Angels were alſo caſt downe with him. <hi>I anſwer.</hi> That more generall Type of the <hi>fourth <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iſion</hi> noted, that the devill with his Angels, was ſo overcome by the death and reſurrection of Chriſt, as that neither he, nor they could ſuppreſſe the Church in its birth and growth. But this more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall <hi>Type</hi> of the <hi>laſt Viſion</hi> denoteth, that the Prince of devils was ſo bound in the firſt thouſand yeers, that neither he himſelfe, nor his Emiſſary Angels could any longer uphold Paganiſme,
<note place="margin">Satans bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood abſolutely.</note> or hinder the courſe of the Goſpell among the Gentiles. The <hi>binding of Satan</hi> therefore muſt not be underſtood abſolutely, as if he then ceaſed altogether to do miſchief, but comparatively, &amp; with limitation, that he could no longer bewitch the nations with ſuch groſſe Idol-worſhip, as he had before done,

Enough of the <hi>binding,</hi> how, and why Satan is bound. Let us ſee the time; It is ſaid in ver. 2. <hi>He bound him for a thouſand yeeres:</hi> Here he ſaith, <hi>That he ſhould deceive the Nations no more, till the thouſand yeers be fulfilled: and after that, hee must be looſed a little ſeaſon.</hi> In which he ſheweth three things.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> how long he ſhal be kept bound: not alwayes, but a definite, or ſet time, <hi>untill thoſe thouſand yeeres ſhould be fulfilled:</hi> ſo that Satans Impriſonment ſhall continue a thouſand yeers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> what ſhalbe afterward: <hi>He muſt be looſed,</hi> that is, from his chaine out of the bottomleſſe Pit, to rage or ſway freely. For as the <hi>binding</hi> was a reſtraint that he could not rage freely among the Nations: ſo his <hi>looſing</hi> ſhall be a permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:96676:278"/>to ſway freely among them, yea among the Chriſtians alſo.</p>

                        </gap>, <hi>He must be looſed,</hi> that is, ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, viz. <hi>by the Angell Christ,</hi> who had bound him before: which may not be underſtood of coaction, as if he ſhould force Chriſt to let him go, and that Chriſt through weakneſſe could keepe him in captivity no longer: nor yet of any abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity, as if God could not do otherwiſe: but of a neceſſity of the divine Counſell; the reaſons of whoſe counſell are known by the events,

                     <p>Therefore the <hi>Dragon muſt be looſed,</hi> becauſe God hath ſo decreed, and that for moſt righteous cauſes: <hi>Firſt,</hi> that it might appear how great the fury and power of Satan is, unleſſe he be reſtrained by God. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that the glory of God might be illuſtrated in the admirable overthrow of the adverſaries, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Saints. <hi>For if he ſhould never be looſed,</hi> ſaith Auſtin,

                        <hi>his maligne power would the leſſe appeare, and the moſt faithfull patience of the holy City be the leſſe tryed: to be ſhort, it would bee the leſſe diſcerned how the Omnipotent God hath ſo well made uſe of Satan to his owne hurt, who hath not altogether taken him away from the tentation of the Saints, although he be caſt forth according to the inward man from true beleevers, that they might withſtand his aſſaults without: and in this reſpect hath bound him, least innumerable perſons ſhould be infected by the pouring out, and exerciſe of his full malice: or that ſuch who ought to encreaſe and multiply the Church (as ſome by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the faith, others already beleeving) ſhould be kept off and withdrawne from the ſame.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>To theſe I adde a morall <hi>Reaſon:</hi> that as for the comfort of the Godly, the whole time of our tribulation in this life, is by the Apoſtle called, <hi>A light af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction

<note place="margin">Cicero de Ancit.</note> It commendeth alſo the wiſdome, goodneſſe, and power of God, who knowes indeed how to prove, and exerciſe his Church: Notwithſtanding hee permits not Satan to rage any longer, then himſelfe pleaſeth, and ſo farre as may ſtand with our weakneſſe.</p>
                     <p>But now at length we come to treat of the <hi>Thouſand yeers:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty about the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeers.</note> And I confeſſe that I take in hand this argument tremblingly: becauſe I ſee that many Interpreters, both Ancient and Moderne, have ſtumbled at this ſtone: And the more I thinke upon it, the leſſe I finde how to unty the knot that hath troubled ſo many: And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done all that I can, I find it more eaſie to ſay what theſe <hi>thouſand years</hi> are not, then what they are. For it ſeemeth that the Holy Ghoſt was pleaſed as it were to <hi>ſeale this Booke</hi> to all men by this darke myſterie, the ſearching whereof might indeed exerciſe our ſtudy, but reſtrain the boldneſſe of a raſh definition. Wherefore I do not promiſe, after all others, ſo to unlooſe this knot touching <hi>the thouſand yeers, and millenary reigne of the Martyrs,</hi> as to ſatisfie all men: but will ſpeake what the LORD hath given me to ſee, following the ſteps of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſo farre as I may.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt</hi> obſerve, that the thouſand years are here ſix times iterated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thrice</hi> it is ſaid that Satan was bound for a thouſand years and afterward loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, verſe 2.3.7.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Twice</hi> it is ſaid that the <hi>Saints ſhall reign a thouſand yeers with Chriſt,</hi> ver. 4.6.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Once, that the reſt of the dead lived not again, till the thouſand yeers were finiſhed,</hi> v. 5.</p>
                     <p>There are therefore a <hi>thouſand yeers</hi> of Satans captivity, and of the reſt of the dead: There are alſo a <hi>thouſand yeers</hi> of the Saints reigning with Chriſt: Whence ariſeth the firſt neceſſary Queſtion of all, <hi>Whether theſe thouſand yeeres bee the ſame, or diverſe?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of old, the <hi>Chiliaſts</hi> or <hi>Millenaries</hi> affirmed them to be diverſe (whoſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is anon to be examined:) And ſome learned Interpreters of theſe times alſo, and among the reſt, BRIGHTMAN, <hi>Theſe thouſand yeers,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in which the Saints ſhall reign with Christ, do begin where the former ended.</hi> Thus Satan ſhould be bound a thouſand years, and afterward Chriſt ſhould reign a thouſand years.</p>
                     <p>But I judge that one, and the ſame terme of a <hi>thouſand yeers</hi> is denoted, and the reaſon is plain in the Text: becauſe in verſe 2. &amp; 6. the <hi>thouſand yeers</hi> are ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> without an article: but foure times afterward with an article <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>Theſe thouſand yeers,</hi> emphatically, and ſignificantly, as if he ſhould ſay, Satans Impriſonment ſhall continue a thouſand yeers, and during theſe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeers, the Martyrs ſhall live, and reign with Chriſt, afterward Satan ſhall be looſed. Wherefore the ſame terme of a thouſand yeers is noted: although in ver. 6. it be more largely extended, as there we ſhall ſee.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo another reaſon, <hi>ab incommodo:</hi> for it ſeems not convenient to ſay, that the Saints, after Satans looſing, and when he again rageth, ſhould then reign: Nay, rather they ſhall reign, Satan being as yet bound: for this raging enemy being looſed, would ſcarce ſuffer them to reign.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, the other opinion doth with the <hi>Chiliaſts</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> too much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate, and circumſcribe the time of <hi>Chriſts</hi> comming to Iudgement, againſt the expreſſe ſaying of Chriſt:

                        <hi>Of that houre and day no man knoweth,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore I ſay, that both Satans binding, and the Saints reigning with Chriſt, ſhall bee in the ſame thouſand yeeres.</p>

                           <hi>that theſe thouſand yeeres ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the whole time from Christs Reſurrection, unto Antichriſts Kingdome:</hi> becauſe by <hi>thouſand,</hi> in Scripture we often underſtand a very great, and indefinite number, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.7. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The like alſo we find in Heatheniſh Writers. <hi>Virgil.</hi> 1. <hi>Aeneid.</hi> 11. <hi>Aene.</hi> 2. <hi>Perſ.

                        <p>But this opinion cannot ſtand, for many cauſes: for <hi>first,</hi> we may not raſhly, and without neceſſity goe from the Letter to Figures: Now here no neceſſitie urgeth us to turne from the proprietie of the letter (about the <hi>thouſand yeers</hi>) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a trope of indefinite ſignification.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the Text it ſelfe yeelds us a weighty reaſon: becauſe Iohn indeed at firſt in verſe 2. determinates the <hi>thouſand yeers</hi> without the Article, having it only <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, but afterward emphatically repeats it foure times with the Article, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> 
                           <hi>theſe thouſand yeers,</hi> and undoubtedly defines the ſame.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> from the Text wee have another evident reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> that during <hi>thoſe thouſand yeers</hi> Antichriſt was worſhipped: for within thoſe thouſand yeers they alſo that <hi>worſhipped not the Image of the Beast,</hi> that is, of Antichriſt, <hi>lived, and
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:96676:280"/>reigned with Christ:</hi> and therefore it cannot be underſtood that theſe <hi>thouſand yeeres</hi> were finiſhed before Antichriſts coming, nor indefinitely untill his coming.</p>
                        <p>We are therefore to embrace their opinion who hold that theſe <hi>thouſand yeers</hi> are definite. And now let us come to conſider the termes.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div n="2" type="section">
                        <p n="2">II. <hi>Where theſe thouſand yeers have their beginning and ending.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Such as underſtand the <hi>thouſand yeers</hi> definitely, are diverſly minded about their beginning, as by and by I will ſhew. I ſuppoſe it beſt to take their beginning from the Angels deſcenſion: becauſe otherwiſe the determination of the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeers, ſo often repeated, ſhould be uncertaine and vaine: I ſay, in caſe they ſhould have an indeterminated beginning elſewhere: Now the <hi>deſcenſion of the Angell</hi> was in the Incarnation of the Son of God, as before we ſhewed. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding Satan was not bound preſently upon his Nativity: becauſe the Son of God did not immediatly exerciſe his power in his Child-hood. But the true beginning is underſtood from the cauſe, why the Dragon ſhould bee bound: which was: <hi>that he ſhould deceive the Nations no more:</hi> to wit, by keeping them in Paganiſme,
<note place="margin">Where we are to begin the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeers.</note> and turning them from the Goſpell of Chriſt. Therefore when the <hi>Dragon</hi> began to deſiſt from deceiving the nations, then he was bound. Now he deſiſted from ſeducing the Nations any longer, not preſently, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Miniſtery, or Reſurrection of Chriſt, or of the preaching of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, (although the Angell did then begin to caſt the great chaine upon the Dragon) but eſpecially after the diſperſion of the Iewes, and the deſtruction of the Iewiſh Temple, and worſhip by the Romanes: for before that time, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of the Gentiles converſion to Chriſt were but ſmall: becauſe the <hi>Dragon</hi> never ceaſed to hinder the Gentiles from the Goſpell of Chriſt, by meanes of the turbulent Iewes, as the Hiſtory of the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles</hi> teſtifies. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, Ieruſalem being deſtroyed, the Iewes were rejected and diſſipated, and in their roome the Gentiles were called, and added to the Church, as Paul teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.46. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.11. &amp;c. Then at length it appeared that Satan was bound, becauſe he was not able <hi>to ſeduce the Nations any longer,</hi> or uphold Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſme. But that was in the yeer of our Lord LXXIII. This yeare therefore we make the beginning of the <hi>thouſand yeers</hi> of Satans binding.</p>
                        <p>From hence unto the <hi>Yeer of our Lord</hi> 1073.
<note place="margin">The end of the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeeres.</note> are a thouſand yeers, at which time <hi>Pope Gregory VII. a Celtiberian Monke,</hi> and diabolicall Iugler, poyſoning <hi>Alexander II.</hi> invaded the Papacy by moſt wicked arts: who ſitting on the <hi>Papall Chaire,</hi> the devill began againe to be looſed, and to rage tumultuouſly, filling the Chriſtian world in a horrible manner with wars and ſlaughters, by the means of this his curſed inſtrument.</p>
                        <p>But thou wilt ſay;
<note place="margin">Whether the Dragon were bound in the firſt thouſand yeers.</note> Did not Satan in the firſt three hundred yeers after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion of the Angell, moſt cruelly afflict the Church by the Romane Tyrants: and in the three hundred following yeers, defiled the Chriſtian world with moſt groſſe hereſies: and in the four hundred ſucceeding yeers, raiſed up the <hi>Romane Antichriſt out of the bottomleſſe Pit,</hi> giving unto him his Throne and great power, working with all manner of unrighteouſneſſe and cruelty in the very heart of the Church? How then could Satan be ſaid to <hi>be bound theſe thouſand yeers,</hi> in which he raged ſo outragiouſly?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>I anſwer:</hi> The binding of Satan (as before I ſaid) may not be abſolutely underſtood, as if he then could not, or did not hurt the Church at all, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictively unto the cauſe expreſſed in the Text, ſo farre as he was then reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from ſeducing the Nations any longer, that they ſhould not embrace the Faith of Chriſt. To this <hi>binding of Satan</hi> it is ſufficient, that then he could not by the Tyrants, Iewes, or Philoſophers, hinder any longer the propagation of the Goſpell among all Nations. And therefore howſoever in great number, the Gentiles were converted to Chriſt, and Paganiſme every where decayed; yet no marvaile, though Satan did rage in his principall members, and breathed out threatnings by the Tyrants of the Romane Empire, and by Hereticks in the
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:96676:280"/>Church it ſelfe: Hence aroſe ſo many perſedutions of the Saints, and ſuch great conflicts of the <hi>Church</hi> with Hereticks; during ſixe hundred yeers: neither is it ſtrange that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> was then raiſed up by Satan: for ſeeing hee was bound himſelf, he gave <hi>his throne and power to Antichriſt,</hi> that the <hi>Beaſt</hi> might be the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car of the Dragon</hi> while he was in bonds, and the more furiouſly exerciſe all his power. Hence the Dragon is ſaid <hi>to have given his Throne to the Beaſt,</hi> Revelat. 13.2.</p>
                        <p>By which it plainely appeareth, how far theſe thouſand yeers do agree with,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>The compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the thouſand yeers with the</hi> 1260. <hi>dayes &amp;</hi> 42. <hi>months.</hi>
                           </note> or differ from the 1260. <hi>dayes,</hi> and the 42. <hi>moneths,</hi> in which the <hi>Holy City</hi> is ſaid <hi>to be troden vnder foot by the Gontiles,</hi> Chapter 11.2. and the <hi>Beaſt</hi> was to rage, Chap. 13.5. In ſome part they agree: for in the laſt foure Ages of theſe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeers, thoſe 1260. <hi>dayes</hi> and 42. <hi>moneths</hi> began to run on: becauſe in them the <hi>Beaſt</hi> began to tread the Church under foot. But they <hi>differ,</hi> in that theſe <hi>thouſand yeers</hi> are referred to Satans binding: the 1260. <hi>dayes,</hi> and the 42. <hi>moneths</hi> to Antichriſts tyrannicall reigne: They are already ended, more then five hundred yeeres: theſe are not fully ended: becauſe the <hi>Beaſt</hi> hath as yet ſcarcely reigned a thouſand yeers.</p>
                        <p>Now thoſe things that are brought againſt this our opinion,
<note place="margin">Objections taken away.</note> are eaſily taken away.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>FIRST,</hi> the <hi>Order of the Propheſie is objected,</hi> viz. <hi>that the Dragon ſhall at length, after the Beaſt is caſt into the Lake of fire, be bound a thouſand yeers in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe Pit: but the caſting of the Beaſt, ſhall bee the ruine of the Papacy; Therefore the thouſand yeers ſhall not be begun, till at length after the ruine of the Papacy.</hi> But the <hi>major</hi> is denyed: becauſe the <hi>casting of the Beaſt into hell</hi> praecedes indeed the binding of the <hi>Dragon</hi> in order of the Viſion, but not in order of time: Before, I ſay, Iohn ſaw the <hi>Beaſt</hi> to be caſt into the lake, in the foregoing <hi>ſixt Viſion:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were the laſt <hi>Act</hi> of that <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iſion:</hi> but not in this laſt <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iſion,</hi> in which is now afterward related the <hi>binding of the Dragon,</hi> the which notwithſtanding praeceded the caſting of the Beaſt, or ruine of the Papacy many Ages, being as it were the firſt Act of this laſt Viſion. The plaine and forcing reaſon hereof is, that the <hi>Beast</hi> and <hi>Falſe-prophet</hi> ſhall not be aboliſhed, but by the brightneſſe of Chriſts comming to judgement. But it is abſurd to imagine that Satan ſhould be bound a thouſand yeers after the laſt Iudgement. The cauſe therefore of the errour is, that the diverſitie of that, and this Viſion, is not obſerved.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, they object: <hi>That if the thouſand yeers muſt begin from the deſtruction of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem: then that time, in which Satan ſhall be again looſed, cannot be called a SHORT SEASON, becauſe it containeth above five hundred, yea about ſixe hundred yeeres.</hi> But the conſequence is denyed: for although the time of <hi>Satans looſing,</hi> hath now bin for theſe five Ages, and perhaps ſhall continue an Age or two more, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the end of the 1260. <hi>dayes,</hi> the which thing the Lord knoweth: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding we have a little before clearly demonſtrated, that it is rightly called a LITTLE SEASON, both in reſpect of God, <hi>as alſo</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>Dragon,</hi> and of the Ages paſt, and <hi>laſtly,</hi> and that indeed principally, in reſpect of the <hi>thouſand yeeres</hi> of Satans binding, then which that time ſhall be ſhorter, becauſe God will ſhorten thoſe dayes for the elects ſake.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, they object: <hi>that ſuch as have not worſhipped the Beaſt, nor received his Character, ſhould not then reigne with Christ thoſe thouſand yeeres.</hi> But this is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed: for the <hi>thouſand yeers</hi> were ended in <hi>Gregory VII.</hi> unto the time of which filthy <hi>Beaſt</hi> more then 460. <hi>yeeres</hi> of Antichriſts reigne were run on, during all which time very many Martyrs and Profeſſours worſhipped not the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and his Image. All theſe therefore after death, did according to their ſoules, <hi>live,
<note place="margin">By the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure called Synecdoche, a part is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the whole.</note> and reigne with Chriſt</hi> in bleſſedneſſe thoſe thouſand yeeres, by a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> becauſe they lived with Chriſt in the laſt foure hundred yeers of the ſaid thouſand. Now in verſe 4: I will plainly ſhew that this <hi>Synecdoche</hi> is neither unuſuall in common ſpeech, nor in Scripture, or that it derogates any thing from the happineſſe of
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:96676:281"/>the latter Martyrs. As therefore the Martyrs lived not altogether, or were all put to death at one time, but ſucceſſively: ſo alſo they began not altogether to live and reigne with CHRIST in Heaven, but ſucceſſively during thoſe thouſand yeeres.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, It is objected, <hi>that the devill was not bound in thoſe firſt thouſand yeers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſeduced very many.</hi> But this was reſolved in the firſt Queſtion: for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are we to imagine, that Satan was ſo <hi>bound,</hi> as that he could not ſeduce, or hurt none at all, neither by his Emiſſary Angels, or by other his inſtruments, as Tyrants, Hereticks, Antichriſt: but onely (as it is expreſſed in the Text) <hi>that he ſhould not deceive the Nations any longer,</hi> that is, uphold Paganiſme, and hinder the courſe of the Goſpell among the Gentiles.</p>
                        <p>Thus I have laid downe my judgement, agreeing with other moſt learned In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters before me, as <hi>Bullinger, Junius,</hi> &amp;c. not that I do tye any man unto it, but leave it to conſideration: but they who begin the <hi>thouſand yeeres</hi> from Chriſts nativity, as <hi>Aretius,</hi> or from his Reſurrection, as <hi>Chytraeus:</hi> or from the time of univerſall Chriſtianiſme under <hi>Conſtantine the Great,</hi> as <hi>Brightman, Napier,</hi> &amp;c. although they differ a little in the termes, yet all have this common with us, that the firſt thouſand yeers from Chriſts birth is to be aſcribed to Satans impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment; and that the <hi>Dragon</hi> is now long agoe looſed out of priſon.</p>
                        <p>There are two other opinions of them, who referre the <hi>thouſand yeeres</hi> unto the laſt times, as if they were not yet begun. <hi>One</hi> of the old <hi>Chiliaſts,</hi> of which I will ſpeak afterward in verſe 5. The <hi>other new,</hi> of certaine learned brethren, that <hi>theſe thouſand yeeres,</hi> are not to begin till after the caſting of the <hi>Beast into the Lake of fire,</hi> that is, after the overthrow of the Papacy. Then they thinke that <hi>he ſhall be bound a thouſand yeers in the bottomleſſe Pit,</hi> and that the Martyrs which have beene ſlaine by <hi>Tyrants</hi> and <hi>Romiſh Popes,</hi> ſhall then corporally live again, and reigne with Chriſt in Heaven thoſe thouſand yeeres: and then at the end of <hi>theſe thouſand yeeres</hi> ſhall be the Reſurrection of all the reſt of the dead, and the laſt Iudgement.</p>
                        <p>Now what I thinke in this opinion to be wanting, I will here touch onely in a generall way, reſerving the reſt to its place.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> I cannot approve, that theſe <hi>thouſand yeeres</hi> are not as yet begun: nor paſt: becauſe two falſe <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> are ſuppoſed: <hi>One,</hi> that Satan hath not as yet bin bound, that he ſhould ſeduce the Nations no longer in Paganiſme, the which is repugnant to the Hiſtory. The <hi>other,</hi> that the world ſhould yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a thouſand yeers after the overthrow of Papacy, which is repugnant to the divine oracles, touching the aboliſhing of ANTICHRIST by the brightneſſe of Chriſts coming, after which, to expect a thouſand yeers in this world, to me feemes very abſurd.</p>
                        <p>They <hi>object</hi> that the Oracles of the Prophets are not yet fulfilled, Ierem. 30. and 31. Mich. 4.3. unto 8. &amp; Mich. 5.9.15. the anſwer of Chriſt, Act. 1.6.7. &amp; Mat. 23.28. Rom. 11.25.</p>
                        <p>But in all theſe, not to be tedious: I would firſt deſire them to ſeeke their thouſand yeers: Secondly, that they diligently conſider whether thoſe Oracles (ſpoken of in verſe fourth) are Propheſies touching the Kingdome of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs in Heaven, or not rather of Chriſts Spirituall Kingdome and State of the Church of the Goſpell on Earth, partly already fulfilled, and partly not, but in time to bee accompliſhed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> that opinion contradicts it ſelfe. For it propoundeth, <hi>that the Pope before theſe thouſand yeeres ſhall be caſt into the Lake of fire, and that Popery ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed:</hi> and withall: <hi>that the Pope during the thouſand yeeres, ſhall by little and little gather his ſtrength, and at the end of the ſaid yeeres, joyne himſelfe with Pagan Kings, to make warre againſt the Saints.</hi> But how ſhall the Pope doe this, being in the Lake of fire?</p>
                        <p>They anſwer, <hi>that the ſame Pope indeed that is caſt into the Lake, ſhall not
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:96676:281"/>reaſſume ſtrength: but there may bee ſome other after him, who ſhall not bee aboliſhed till the brightneſſe of Chriſts comming.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But this is to dally in a ſerious matter. The ruine of the Papacy, in which they fixe the beginning of the <hi>thouſand yeers,</hi> we underſtand not to be the caſting of one or two of the Popes into the Lake, (for many are already caſt away) but the overthrow of the whole Papacy. Here then, let them explaine themſelves, whether they underſtand it of the overthrow of Papacy <hi>in part,</hi> or <hi>totally.</hi> If they underſtand it onely in <hi>part,</hi> they muſt ſay, that Satan hath bin bound above an hundred yeers, becauſe, ſince that time Papacy hath gone to decay in <hi>Germany,</hi> and ſome other Kingdomes: which thing <hi>Bellarmin</hi> alſo confeſſeth: <hi>for,</hi> ſaith he,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Bell. Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de</hi> P.R. <hi>Cap.</hi> 21.</note> 
                           <hi>from that time, ſince you affirmed the Pope to be Antichrist, his Empire hath beene ſo farre from encreaſing, that it hath alwayes more and more decreaſed.</hi> If of an <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall</hi> or <hi>totall</hi> overthrow, how then ſhall the <hi>Beaſt</hi> gather ſtrength by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, eſpecially while he is in the lake of fire?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> they take up another abſurdity againſt the Text, <hi>viz.</hi> that in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>thouſand yeeres, the Martyrs ſhall corporally live againe, and reigne with Christ a thouſand yeers:</hi> whereas the Text expreſſely ſpeaketh of their ſoules, not of the bodies of the Martyrs: neither ſaith it, that they <hi>lived again,</hi> or <hi>were rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up from death,</hi> but that they <hi>lived,</hi> of which in ver. 4.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> they frame another abſurdity, in pretending a two-fold reſurrection of the dead: <hi>One</hi> of the Martyrs after the overthrow of the Papacy: <hi>the other,</hi> of the reſt of the dead, after the thouſand yeers reigne of the Martyrs: the which is contrary to an Article of our Faith: <hi>I beleeve the reſurrection of the fleſh,</hi> that is, of all the dead at the laſt day: and it is refuted by experience.

                        <p>Now it followeth to ſpeake of the manner of this <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and what it is. The <hi>Chiliaſts</hi> ſaid it was <hi>corporall,</hi> but here is ſolidly demonſtrated, that a corporall raiſing up of the Martyrs out of their Sepulchres, is not proper unto the Martyrs, but that it muſt be underſtood of a Spirituall living again from the death of ſin, in all that ſhall be ſaved.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>That the firſt Reſurrection is not to be underſtood corporally, but spiritually.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> from the differences dividing the whole Subject. This <hi>first Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> is either corporall, or ſpirituall. But it is not corporall: Therefore it is ſpirituall. The <hi>aſſumption</hi> is proved: If this Reſurrection ſhould be corporall, then it could not be called <hi>the Firſt,</hi> becauſe many Corporall Reſurrections are ſpoken of in Scripture before. I. The Reſurrection of the Son of the Widow of <hi>Sarepta,</hi> corporally raiſed up by <hi>Elias,</hi> 1. King. 17.22. which is the firſt reſurrection mentioned in Scripture. II. The Reſurrection of the ſon of the <hi>Shu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nammite,</hi> raiſed up by <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 2. King. 4.35. III. The Reſurrection of one put into the grave, by touching the bones of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 2. King. 13.21. IIII. The Reſurrection of a <hi>Widows ſon,</hi> raiſed by Chriſt, Luk. 7.15. V. Of the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Jairus,</hi> Luk. 8.55. VI. Of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> Iohn. 11.44. VII. The Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of many of thoſe Saints, who came forth out of the Sepulchre, when Chriſt ſuffered on the Croſſe, Mat. 27.52. VIII. The Reſurrection of <hi>Tabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha,</hi> raiſed by <hi>Peter,</hi> Act. 9.41. IX. The Reſurrection of <hi>Eutychus,</hi> brought from death to life by <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 20.10, &amp;c. And therfore if the Reſurrection here ſpoken of were corporall, it ſhould not be called the <hi>firſt,</hi> but at leaſt the tenth.</p>
                        <p>Neither helps it to object, that the foreſaid <hi>Reſurrections</hi> were onely of a few: but that this ſhall be of very many: for the Queſtion is not touching the number of them that are to be raiſed up: but of the Qualitie and Order of the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and it followeth (ſeeing that is not the <hi>first</hi> of the ſame <hi>Genus,</hi> which hath many other before it) either that this cannot be called the <hi>Firſt Reſurrection,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which there were many other: or elſe that it is not of the ſame kind with the other Reſurrections, that is, it is not corporall.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> This <hi>Reſurrection</hi> being taken corporally and properly, muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood either of the <hi>Soules of the Martyrs,</hi> or of the <hi>reſt of the dead,</hi> or of none. Of the ſoules of the Martyrs it cannot be underſtood: <hi>both,</hi> becauſe it is not ſaid of them, that they were <hi>raiſed,</hi> or <hi>lived againe;</hi> But, that they <hi>ſate on thrones, lived, and reigned with Chriſt,</hi> as before was ſhewed: <hi>As alſo,</hi> becauſe properly a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Reſurrection is not agreeable to Soules: ſeeing Soules properly die not, as not being bodies, neither of the nature thereof: nor can it be underſtood of the <hi>reſt of the dead:</hi> becauſe of theſe it is expreſly ſaid, that they <hi>lived not againe.</hi> Therefore this firſt corporall Reſurrection cannot be true of any at all.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The whole Scripture teſtifies, that ALL, I ſay, ALL the dead, ſhall in one Reſurrection, at the laſt day be raiſed by the Trumpet and Voyce of the <hi>Archangell,</hi> ſome indeed unto eternall Life, others unto eternall ſhame: Iohn 5.28. <hi>The houre commeth, in which ALL that are in the Graves ſhall hear his voyce, and ſhall come forth: they that have done good, unto the Reſurrection of Life, and they that have done evill unto the Reſurrection of damnation,</hi> Iohn 11.24. <hi>I know that my brother ſhall riſe againe in the Reſurrection, at the laſt day.</hi> Iohn 6.48. <hi>This is the will of him that ſent mee, that every one that ſeeth the Sonne, and beleeveth in him, ſhould have Eternall Life: And I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi> From this
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:96676:285"/>univerſall, the Martyrs cannot be excepted, becauſe they beleeved on the Sonne of God. 1. Cor. 15.52. <hi>We ſhall all be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the laſt Trumpe, for the Trumpet ſhall ſound, and the dead ſhall bee raiſed.</hi> 1. Theſſ. 4.16. <hi>At the comming of the Lord, they that dyed in Chriſt, ſhall riſe firſt.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Martyrs</hi> alſo who dyed in Chriſt, ſhall riſe at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Lord. <hi>Iohn</hi> alſo toward the end of this very Chapter, deſcribeth the <hi>Second Reſurrection,</hi> which ſhall bee at the laſt day, ſo univerſall, as that all the Elements ſhall give up their dead, (a great part whereof ſhall bee Martyrs, being deſtroyed by Fire and Water.) By all which, I ſuppoſe that no Godly man, can, or ought to gather any other thing, then that <hi>all the dead</hi> ſhall be raiſed together in one Reſurrection at the laſt day: but that many millions of Saints ſhould be raiſed before the laſt day, cannot without errour be beleeved.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> the Apoſtle Paul moſt exactly deſcribing the whole Hiſtory (and what we ought to beleeve) of the Reſurrection, opens indeed a <hi>Myſterie</hi> unto us: 1. Cor. 15.51. viz. <hi>That all ſhall not die, but in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, all ſhalbe changed.</hi> Yet not a word touching the myſterie of the <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linarie Reſurrection</hi> of the Martyrs before others. If thou ſay, that it was not revealed unto him: Conſider that the Apoſtle was <hi>caught up into the third heaven,</hi> 2. Cor. 12.4. and heard <hi>unſpeakable words,</hi> that is, all kind of myſteries, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuch as were to bee revealed unto the Church. And therefore undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly hee ſhould have heard that alſo, for to reveale the ſame unto us, and would have revealed it, if it were true.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fiftly,</hi> from the nature of Oppoſites: So as is the firſt death, ſo on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is the firſt Reſurrection to be underſtood. For I ſuppoſe none will deny, but that theſe two are privatively oppoſites, as being contrary-wiſe affected about the ſame ſubject. But the firſt death, was not of the body or corporall,
<note place="margin">The firſt death what it is.</note> but the death of the Soule, or Spirituall through fin: by which man was firſt ſeparated from God, made mortall, and deprived of Life Eternall. For by this death <hi>Adam</hi> was dead in Soule, although in the body he lived nine hundred yeeres after. But the death of the Soule drew with it corporall death, as it were by a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, and ſo perpetually drawes the ſame with it on all the Poſterity of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> by the threatning of God: <hi>Thou ſhalt die the death.</hi> Of this firſt Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all death the Apoſtle ſpeaketh: <hi>Through ſinne death entred into the world,
<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12.</note> and ſo death paſſed upon all men, for all have ſinned:</hi> including indeed the Sequell of a corporall death: but eſpecially ſhewing the deliverance from ſpirituall death, through the death and life of Chriſt. Of this death alſo <hi>Auſtine: The ſoules al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi> (ſaith he,) <hi>have their death in impietie and ſinnes, according to which death they are dead, of whom the Lord ſaith: Let the dead bury their dead: and according to this firſt Death, wee are all dead in ſinnes, no man excepted: becauſe it is ſaid of all men: when ye were dead in ſinnes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Seeing therefore the <hi>First Death</hi> was a Spirituall deſtruction and alienation of the Soule from God, and eternall Life through ſinne: certainely the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection (being an oppoſite medicine to the firſt death) muſt bee a Spirituall converſion, and reſtoring of the Soule from ſin to God.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sixtly,</hi> If the <hi>First Reſurrection</hi> were corporall, and properly belonging to the Martyrs: then onely the Martyrs ſhould bee bleſſed, but all others that riſe at the laſt Day, ſhould be excluded from happineſſe. But this is very abſurd. And therefore the other alſo. The reaſon of the conſequence is, becauſe in the following verſe, onely ſuch are ſaid to be <hi>bleſſed, who have part in the firſt Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection:</hi> of which we ſhall there ſpeak.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Seventhly,</hi> from the ſame verſe: If the <hi>Firſt Reſurrection</hi> were corporall, and proper to Martyrs: then all the dead at the laſt Day ſhould bee raiſed unto the ſecond death, or unto eternall damnation, none of them unto life eternall. But the latter is falſe, and contrary to Scripture, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.24. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2. &amp;c. Therefore the former alſo. The conſequence of the <hi>Major</hi> is grounded on the
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:96676:286"/>following Verſe, where the <hi>Second,</hi> or <hi>Eternall Death</hi> is ſaid to have power onely over them that have no part in the <hi>Firſt Reſurrection,</hi> as there wee ſhall ſee.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Laſtly,</hi> in the ſame Verſe it is ſaid, that they onely ſhall be <hi>Prieſts of God, and of Chriſt, which have part in the firſt Reſurrection,</hi> as ſhall be ſhewed. Whence againe it would follow, that the Martyrs onely ſhould be the Prieſts of God and of Chriſt, in caſe that the firſt Reſurrection were corporall, and proper to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs. But Peter teacheth the contrary, 1. Pet. 2.5.9. And <hi>Iohn,</hi> Rev. 1.6, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Theſe</hi> things I ſuppoſe may ſatisfie the Godlie minded, and ſuch as are not contentious: unto which I will onely adde this one thing, touching the Etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie of the <hi>Firſt Reſurrection:</hi> that as the <hi>firſt death</hi> is ſo called, becauſe it firſt ſeazed on man,
<note place="margin">Why the firſt Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is ſo called.</note> according to the ſoule, as ſoon as he had ſinned: ſo the <hi>firſt Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> is ſo called, becauſe it firſt vivified man according to the Soule, as ſoone as he repented by hearing the promiſe in Paradiſe. Or alſo (which comes all to one thing) becauſe it is the vivification of the firſt or more noble part, that is, of the ſoule: as alſo becauſe it is wrought in the <hi>Firſt,</hi> that is, in this naturall life: and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly, becauſe it muſt goe before the <hi>Second reſurrection,</hi> which ſhall be the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the bodyes to glory or, if the firſt went not before, unto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
                        <p>Here I could adde the Authorities of ancient Divines. But it's needleſſe: Let <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſuffice for all the reſt, who moſt diligently ſearched into this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; <hi>The firſt Reſurrection</hi> (ſaith he moſt truely) <hi>is to Grace, the ſecond to Glorie,</hi> Lib. 20. de Civ. Dei. C. 7.18. Him <hi>Ribera</hi> unjuſtly reproveth, reſtraining the <hi>Firſt Reſurrection</hi> unto the immortality of ſoules, <hi>that the Martyrs, though estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as if they had utterly periſhed, yet according to their better part, they live.</hi> Then which, nothing is more unſavoury: for in this hee attributes nothing more to Martyrs, then to the <hi>worſhippers of the Beaſt,</hi> who themſelves alſo after the death of their bodies, lived in their better part, and yet never lived in the firſt Reſurrection.</p>

                        <p>OBJECT. I. <hi>That which falleth not, neither dyeth, is not raiſed again. The ſoules fall not, neither dye, but the bodies. Therefore the Firſt Reſurrection is not of ſoules, but of bodies.</hi>

The ſoule of man therefore fell through ſinne, and lies dead in ſinne: liveth againe through Faith, and riſeth againe by repentance. Therefore there is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Soules alſo: but not the Second: for this ſhall be of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: Therefore the Firſt.</p>
                        <p>Object. II. <hi>The Soules of Martyrs lived againe, either in respect of themſelves, or in respect of their bodies, or in respect of other men, who profeſſed the ſame Doctrine. But they lived not againe in respect of themſelves, becauſe they were never dead: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reſpect of other men: becauſe it would follow, that the reſt of the dead ſhould likewiſe live againe: which is falſe. Therefore they lived againe in respect of their owne bodies.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>I anſwer:</hi> I do not well underſtand whether this be in earneſt or in jeſt: The whole is ſo frivolous, and hangs no more together, then if they ſhould ſay: <hi>The Soules flie, either in respect of themſelves, or in respect of their bodies, or in respect of other men, &amp;c. Not in reſpect of themſelves, becauſe they have no wings, neither in reſpect of other men, becauſe they alſo ſhould flie: which is falſe. Therefore in reſpect of
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:96676:286"/>their bodies:</hi> The Hypotheſis is falſe, the diſtribution vaine and lame, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence nothing, for this is wanting: <hi>or they flie in no reſpect.</hi> So here the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is to be denyed: becauſe they take up a falſehood, viz. <hi>that the ſoules did live again,</hi> for in the Text it is ſaid <hi>they lived,</hi> not that <hi>they lived againe:</hi> Hence the diſtribution is vaine and imperfect, for a fourth is wanting, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Soules lived not againe in any reſpect, to wit, corporally, which is the Queſtion here in hand. For a falſe attribute divideth not, but overthrowes the ſubject by its falſitie, neither is it truely affirmed of the ſame but denyed. Adde, that the <hi>firſt clauſe,</hi> with the reaſon thereof, is ambiguous: for howſoever ſoules dye not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther live againe in reſpect of themſelves, that is, in reſpect of their eſſence, yet they do dye, and live againe in reſpect of themſelves, that is, in reſpect of Grace and Salvation, as hath been ſhewed. <hi>The other</hi> is ſuperfluous and figurative. For no man <hi>liveth againe</hi> in reſpect of others, except metaphorically: as for example: A father liveth again in his children, in likeneſſe of nature and manners: The <hi>two Witneſſes,</hi> Chap. 11.11. <hi>lived againe</hi> in their Succeſſours, in likeneſſe of doctrine. And therefore in this alſo is an aequivocation or ambiguitie. <hi>The third,</hi> which is concluded, is alſo a figurative <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> or is falſe. For as properly not the Soules, but the Martyrs were dead in reſpect of their bodies, ſo properly not the ſoules, but Martyrs ſhall live againe in reſpect of their bodies at the laſt day. Therefore ingeniouſly, and without Sophiſtrie, the <hi>Object:</hi> ſhould thus have bin formed. <hi>The Martyrs lived againe either in reſpect of their ſoules, or in reſpect of their bodies. Not in regard of their ſoules: therefore in reſpect of their bodies.</hi> But thus alſo the whole <hi>major</hi> is falſe; the <hi>minor</hi> ambiguous, the Conſequence nothing: for then the Martyrs <hi>lived not againe,</hi> but <hi>lived</hi> according to their Soules: but they ſhall live at the laſt day, according to their bodies. Therefore properly there are as many faults, as words.</p>
                        <p>Ob. III. From the Antitheſis, ver. 4. &amp; ver. 5. <hi>If the word LIVED in the former part of the Antitheſis, muſt be underſtood of a Spirituall Reſurrection, then by the like reaſon the words LIVED AGAINE in the latter clauſe, muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of that ſpirituall Reſurrection. But this cannot bee: for it would follow that none did ſpiritually live againe (that is, were converted) in the thouſand yeeres, but the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs alone. Secondly, this abſurditie would alſo follow: that the thouſand yeeres being fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, all which Spiritually dyed, did, or ſhall ſpiritually riſe againe: the which thing is contrary to manifeſt experience.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I anſwer: 1. Again they take up a falſe Antecedent, viz. <hi>that in the former mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber a ſpirituall Reſurrection ought to be understood:</hi> for the former clauſe ſpeaketh of no <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> whither Spirituall, or Corporall, but of the happy living of the bleſſed Soules with Chriſt: for he ſaith not, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           <hi>And they lived with Chriſt,</hi> which <hi>two</hi> we deny to be of like force and ſignification. Now from a falſe <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> or ſuppoſition, the conſequences which are thence drawn are alſo falſe. Hence. 2. the whole concluſion is falſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the diverſe words <hi>lived,</hi> and <hi>lived again,</hi> make both members or clauſes to be of a diverſe ſenſe: neither are they truely Oppoſites, as was ſhewed in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Text.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. The <hi>Aſſumption</hi> is alſo denyed, that the latter member cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of a Spirituall Reſurrection, for a little before we ſhewed, that it ought ſo to be taken. IV. The former abſurditie followes not, <hi>both</hi> becauſe to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs are added the Profeſſours alſo, which received not the <hi>Character of the Beaſt,</hi> that is, who refuſed to embrace and profeſſe the Papiſts Religion, verſe 4. Hence Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories teſtifie, that beſides the Martyrs, there were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſome other profeſſing Chriſtians: <hi>As alſo</hi> becauſe the Speech is indefinite, and uſuall in Scripture: <hi>The reſt of the dead were not converted:</hi> not as if none at all were converted, but very few: as appeares from a like place, Chap. 9.18.20. where at the <hi>ſounding of the ſixt trumpet,</hi> it is ſaid, that the <hi>third part of men</hi> being
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:96676:287"/>ſlaine, <hi>the rest repented not,</hi> the which unleſſe it bee indefinitely underſtood, a greater abſurditie then this ſhould follow, viz. <hi>that not one man in the whole world did then repent.</hi> LASTLY, the latter abſurditie, <hi>that the thouſand yeeres beeing ended, all Spiritually dead ſhould alſo ſpiritually riſe againe,</hi> (which were much to be wiſhed) doth no more follow, then, that the ſaid yeers being ended, the ſoules of Martyrs and Profeſſours ſhould neither live nor reign any longer with Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>Objec. IV. From the ſame Antitheſis: <hi>If the latter member</hi> ver. 5. <hi>ſpeaketh of the Reſurrection of bodies: then the former</hi> in ver. 4. <hi>ſpeaketh of a Reſurrection of bodies alſo, where its ſaid of the Soules of the Martyrs:</hi> And they lived, <hi>that is,</hi> lived againe. <hi>The reaſon of the conſequence is: becauſe in every lawfull diſtribution, as this is, (for who ſhould taxe the Holy Ghost of abſurditie) members are ſet downe under the ſame Genus</hi> or generall word. <hi>Now the Genus here is the Reſurrection of the dead.</hi>

Now in v. 4. was ſhewed that this Antitheſis is ſuch.</p>
                        <p>Objec. V. <hi>They who ſo live againe or riſe, as they begin to reigne with Chriſt, that is, by Christ in Heaven: they certainely riſe in their bodies, But the Soules of the Martyrs are ſo to live againe, or riſe in the beginning of thoſe thouſand yeeres, as that they begin to reigne with (that is, by) Christ in Heaven: for John ſaith:</hi> They lived and reigned with Chriſt. <hi>Therefore, &amp;c.</hi>

The <hi>major</hi> is denyed <hi>a non cauſa:</hi> for to the end, that the Soules of Martyrs and Confeſſours ſhould live bleſſedly, and reigne with Chriſt in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven before the laſt day, a corporall Reſurrection is not neceſſary. But at the laſt day it ſhall be neceſſary, to the end that the Martyrs both in body and in ſoule, may gloriouſly live and reigne with CHRIST for ever, according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Goſpell. II. <hi>The aſſumption</hi> is refuted by the proofe it ſelfe, or by Iohns owne words: for he ſaith not, that the Soules <hi>lived againe,</hi> or <hi>were raiſed:</hi> but <hi>they lived</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>They inſiſt: <hi>To live and reigne with Christ, is to live and reigne after the ſimilitude of Christ, or ſo to live and reigne, as Chriſt now reigneth in Heaven. But Chriſt liveth and reigneth in ſoule and bodie. Therefore the Martyrs not onely lived and reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with him in ſoule, but in body alſo.</hi>

                           <hi>I anſwer.</hi> I. This gloſſe overthrows the former: for if to live with Chriſt, be to live after the likeneſſe of Chriſt in Heaven: then it is falſe, that it is to live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, or be raiſed from the dead on Earth. II. The <hi>major</hi> ſhall be true after the Reſurrection of the dead at the laſt day, when all the Martyrs, Profeſſours, and Beleevers being raiſed from death, ſhall in ſoule and body be allwayes with the Lord,

                        <p>Ob. VI. <hi>It is agreeable to the juſtice of God, that ſuch as ſuffered more grievouſly then others, for the confeſſion of Chriſt, ſhould alſo enjoy longer delight and glory.

                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> The major, not being univerſall, is falſe: for God doth not all what is agreeable to his juſtice now, or before the Day of Iudgement, but will doe the
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:96676:287"/>ſame at that Day; See 2. Theſſ. 1.6.7.8.10. Neither is every thing agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to divine juſtice, which ſeemes ſo to us, but whatſoever is revealed in the Scripture: otherwiſe indeed it might ſeeme to us to bee more agreeable to the juſtice of God, that the Martyrs ſhould preſently be raiſed after their ſufferings, and be carried with their bodies into Heaven, that ſo they might longer, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others, enjoy the Kingdom of glory.</p>
                        <p>Objec. VII. <hi>The two Martyrs,</hi> Rev. 11.11. <hi>were corporally raiſed: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe alſo.</hi>

                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> I. The Antecedent is denyed: for neither doth that type ſpeake of a corporall Reſurrection according to the Letter, but of a ſucceſſive living againe, as was there ſhewed. II. They who confound <hi>them</hi> with <hi>theſe,</hi> ſhew that they are but ſtrangers to the <hi>Revelation:</hi> for theſe Martyrs and Confeſſours belong to the firſt ten Ages from Chriſts birth: The other <hi>two</hi> unto our laſt times, in which the <hi>Temple was to be meaſured,</hi> or the Church purged from Popery.</p>
                        <p>Objec. VIII. <hi>The Prophets, and many Martyrs, came forth out of their Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres at Christs death on the Croſſe: Mat.</hi> 27.53. <hi>according to the Propheſie of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel, Chap.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Neither was that corporall Reſurrection any way derogatorie to the Article of Faith, touching the future univerſall Reſurrection: Therefore alſo theſe Martyrs lived againe corporally, neither is it any way derogatorie to the univerſall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the dead.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> Whether thoſe Saints (whoſe bodies came out of the Sepulchres, and appeared to many, after Chriſts Reſurrection, to teſtifie the efficacie of his Death) were <hi>Prophets</hi> or <hi>Martyrs</hi> appeares not from the Text: neither is it a point of Faith to know the ſame. However the Propheſie of <hi>Daniel</hi> cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wreſting bee applied to theſe, which expreſly ſpeaketh, not onely of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of ſuch as ſhall be ſaved, but of the damned alſo, that is, of the <hi>laſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall Reſurrection.</hi> But that <hi>ſpeciall</hi> and <hi>corporall</hi> Reſurrection of thoſe Saints, is certainly to be believed, becauſe it is written: neither can it be derogatorie to our beleefe of the univerſall Reſurrection, ſeeing the Scripture doth plainely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this from that. But this Reſurrection of the <hi>Martyrs a thouſand yeers</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that, is not to be beleeved, becauſe it is not written: but onely (as we have ſhewed) ſought to be maintained by wreſting the words of this Propheſie: yea, it derogates from the Faith: becauſe he that beleeveth this, cannot beleeve the other, <hi>viz.</hi> that there ſhall be a univerſall Reſurrection at the laſt day.</p>
                        <p>Objec. IX. Chriſt promiſed it ſhould be ſo, Mat. 19.28. &amp; Luk. 22.28. <hi>In the regeneration when the Son of man ſhall ſit in the throne of his glory, ye ſhall ſit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve Tribes of Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi>

                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe indeed are moſt ſweet promiſes of our Saviour, touching the ſingular rewards of the Apoſtles in Heavenly Glory, and touching the large re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of their labours and loſſe of all things, which here they ſuſtained for the ſake of Chriſt. But it is erroneous to beleeve, that here any thing is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed touching <hi>a corporall reſurrection of the Martyrs</hi> that ſhall be before the reſt of the dead, and of <hi>a golden Age</hi> to continue <hi>a thouſand yeeres</hi> before the laſt day, in which (the Martyrs reigning with Chriſt in Heaven) the Iewes beeing joyned to Chriſtians, and freed from the yoke of all adverſaries, ſhall (as the opinion of ſome is) ſerve Chriſt in all manner of proſperity and peace. Let ſuch, I ſay, ſee too, leaſt they erre: and diligently conſider,
<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Act.</hi> 3.21.</note> that thoſe rewards are promiſed to be fulfilled in the <hi>regeneration</hi> or <hi>restitution of all things</hi> at the laſt day: promiſed alſo, Mark 10.30. <hi>with perſecutions:</hi> which things are plainely repugnant unto the <hi>Millenary Reſurrection,</hi> and peace before the laſt day.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly they pretend, <hi>that it were greatly for the comfort of the Martyrs, if they knew, that a little after their martyrdome (the thouſand yeers being near at hand) they ſhould riſe againe, and aſcend both in ſoule and body into Heaven, and reign with Chriſt a thouſand yeers before the reſt of the Faithfull.</hi>

                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> To ſeek for comfort in a doubtfull thing, is to feed upon the wind: in a

But this is ſolid and double comfort to the Martyrs, if from the ſure word of God, they do beleeve that their Soules, as ſoone as they goe out of their bodies, ſhall live and reigne with Chriſt in Heaven, and that at the laſt day, (when their brethren and fellow ſervants, who are to be ſlaine on earth, ſhall be fulfilled) their bodies alſo being raiſed up by the Son of God,

For we alſo were ſometime of this opinion, but ſeeing they affirme, that ſuch who ſhould riſe againe, ſhall enjoy carnall Feaſts, and eat and drinke beyond meaſure and modeſty, theſe things cannot be beleeved but by carnall men, and therefore ſuch as were ſpirituall, called them that believed theſe things CHILIASTS, being a Greek word, and by us may be rendred MILLENARIES.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The firſt Author of this opinion,

                        <p>Furthermore the <hi>Chiliaſts Fable</hi> occaſioned many which diſ-approved the ſame, but were not able to refute it, to fall into another errour worſe then the former, affirming, <hi>that the Revelation was to bee rejected, as written by the Hereticke</hi> CERINTHVS.

                        <p>Now for the refuting of this old Fiction of the <hi>Chiliaſts</hi> (which <hi>Jerome</hi> in the life of <hi>Papias</hi> calleth a <hi>Jewiſh tradition</hi>) we may briefly obſerve, that it conſiſts neither with the preſent Viſion, nor with it ſelfe, nor with other Scriptures, nor Chriſtian beliefe.

                        <p>

                           </note> who have part in the firſt Reſurrection. <hi>To have part in a thing,</hi> is to become partaker of that thing: as appeares from the contrary: <hi>Thou haſt neither part nor lot in this matter,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Simon</hi> the hypocrite: And Chriſt to Peter, refuſing to be waſhed by him: <hi>If I waſh thee not thou bast no part with me,</hi> for, thou ſhalt not have no communion with me. Therefore to have part in the firſt Reſurrection, is to be partaker of the firſt Reſurrection, that is, through faith and repentance, to riſe from the death of ſinne unto newneſſe of Life with Chriſt. For we clearly ſhewed erewhile, that this <hi>first Reſurrection,</hi> is not of the body, but of the ſoule. By which we ſee the great benefit and excellency of the firſt Reſurrection: becauſe in it conſiſteth true bleſſedneſſe and holineſſe. The neceſſity alſo, becauſe no man ſhall bee bleſſed and holy without the ſame. But is it the cauſe of bleſſedneſſe? yea verily: not indeed the meritorious (for that Chriſt onely is, for he hath merited bleſſedneſſe for us,) but <hi>cauſa ſine qua non,</hi> a cauſe without which it is not: <hi>for without holineſſe,</hi> which the firſt Reſurrection bringeth,

                        <p>Hence <hi>firſt</hi> it followeth, that all having <hi>part in the firſt Reſurrection,</hi> that is, being truly born again in this life, ſhalbe bleſſed, and holy with Chriſt in the other Life: and on the <hi>contrary,</hi> that none which riſe not againe with Chriſt, unto new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and holineſſe of life on Earth, ſhall be bleſſed and holy with Chriſt in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:

                           <hi>Secondly</hi> it followeth, as before we proved, that the <hi>Firſt Reſurrection</hi> is not corporall, but ſpirituall: for if it were corporall, then by this Exclamation, all that ſhall be raiſed at the laſt day, ſhould be excluded from bleſſedneſſe, becauſe none of them ſhould have part in the firſt Corporall Reſurrection. But this is abſurd, becauſe in the laſt day, ſome ſhall riſe unto bleſſedneſſe, others unto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death.

                        <p>But perhaps thou wilt ſay, <hi>it will not hold: becauſe as in Chap.</hi> 1.3. <hi>a speciall bleſſedneſſe is promiſed to the keepers of the words of this Booke, ſo here alſo ſome speciall and eminent felicity of the Martyrs is commended, by which notwithſtanding other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers are no way deprived of their bleſſedneſſe.

                        <p>Theſe are either the effects or conſequents of the firſt Reſurrection, and as it were the priviledges of the regenerate, firſt indeed, they are to be referred to the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> but <hi>ſecondly</hi> alſo unto all others that are partakers of the firſt Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or ſpirituall living againe. For leaſt we ſhould ſay: <hi>ſhall the Martyrs alone live and reigne with Chriſt in bleſſedneſse?</hi> he extends the bleſſed life, the <hi>Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Kingdome of Christ</hi> unto us alſo, pronouncing us <hi>bleſſed,</hi> and that indeed by a three-fold name, not the Martyrs (I ſay) alone, but whoſoever have part in the <hi>firſt Reſurrection:</hi> that by ſo many ſpurs as it were, he might ſtirre up all men unto the deſire and ſtudie of the <hi>First Reſurrection.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Therefore the firſt bleſſedneſſe of them that <hi>live againe,</hi> ſhall be an immunitie or ſecurity from the ſecond death: for they that have part in the <hi>First Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, on ſuch the ſecond death hath no power,</hi> that is, they can never periſh.

Now before we ſhewed that the <hi>firſt death</hi> is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall perdition of the Soule in ſinne, drawing with it temporall death as its nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſary ſequell:

                           <hi>That the Scripture by the ſame thouſand yeeres determinates both, to wit, Satans binding, and the Saints reigning.</hi> Which being obſerved, it appeareth that the <hi>Chiliaſts</hi> opinion cannot ſtand, <hi>viz.</hi> that Satan ſhould be bound in the <hi>ſixt Millenary</hi> of the world (in which they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme Chriſt was borne:) and that in the <hi>ſeventh Millenary</hi> the Saints ſhall reigne with Chriſt on Earth: Beſides neither can the opinion of <hi>Brightman</hi> hold, that <hi>Satan was bound a thouſand yeers from Conſtantine, untill the yeere of our Lord</hi> 1300. after which Chriſt ſhould reigne another thouſand yeeres, by the Goſpell on Earth with his Elect, untill the yeer 2300. in which <hi>Millenary</hi> the <hi>Gogiſh</hi> or <hi>Turkiſh</hi> battles ſhould be fought: whence he gathereth that the truth of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell ſhall triumph among the Nations ſeven hundred yeers: a thing indeed more to be wiſhed, then expected with any probability.</p>

                        <p>Its true, he was not the <hi>firſt Antichriſt,</hi> neither did the ſeduction of Chriſtians from the faith, begin with him: for the <hi>Romiſh Antichriſtianiſme</hi> had bin grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and greatly encreaſing above three hundred yeers before.

                        <p>After much contention, <hi>Hildebrand</hi> called <hi>Gregory</hi> under a falſe pretence of ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie wrang out of the hands of <hi>Henry</hi> (that valiant Emperour) and his Sonne <hi>Henry V.</hi> the Epiſcopall Inveſtures, as they terme it, which till then were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Right and Crowne of the Empire: yea alſo thruſt <hi>Henry</hi> himſelfe from the Empire through his wicked ſonne.

With this grew up the innumerable <hi>fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> and <hi>families of Clergy-men,</hi> Sacrificers, Monkes, and Religious Sects, who all of them being exempted from civill juriſdiction, are onely ſubject to the Popes Scepter.

                        <p>Neither was this horrible declining of Chriſtianitie in the Weſt onely.

                        <p>The firſt occaſion of this <hi>Gogiſh</hi> battle was that warre in Paleſtina againſt the <hi>Saracens,</hi> raiſed by the Popes of Rome after the expiration of the thouſand fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall yeers, called <hi>Holy</hi> as it were moſt unholy: the firſt Author whereof was that <hi>Hildebrand</hi> called <hi>Gregory VII.</hi> who began to ſolicite Chriſtian Emperours, Kings, and Princes to recover the <hi>holy Land</hi> by force of Armes. After him <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus II.</hi> (for his turbulent counſells called <hi>Turbanus</hi>) obtained, that many great Armies, wearing the <hi>ſigne of the Croſſe,</hi> ſhould be ſent into <hi>Syria</hi> under divers Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines.

For <hi>Saladine</hi> a Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh King, <hi>Calyph of Damaſcus</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> being drawne on through the inteſtine diſcord of Chriſtian Princes, and by the treachery of the Tripolitan Earle, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw al the Chriſtian Forces in one day, bringing their Princes with King <hi>Gwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do himſelfe,</hi> and all Paleſtina under his power.</p>
                        <p>This was the beginning of the <hi>Gogiſh battell:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Gogish war</note> for the Saracens taking this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and ſeeing that the Chriſtians, whoſe power before they much feared, were not unconquereable, they began to thirſt after whole Chriſtendome, and by degrees brought under ſubjection by their cruell Armies all the <hi>Maritime Africa,</hi> all the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> even unto <hi>Berſia,</hi> at laſt alſo the <hi>leſſer Aſia,</hi> both Countries of <hi>Armenia, Thracia, Pontus, Bulgaria, Greece, Sclavonia,</hi> even unto <hi>Hungarie,</hi> and the borders of <hi>Germany:</hi> driving Chriſtianiſme into the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt corner of <hi>Europe.</hi>

                        <p>This is that <hi>Gogiſh warre,</hi> which Satan after the thouſand fatall yeers, hath with great ſucceſſe waged above five hundred yeeres againſt the Chriſtians by <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> that is, by the <hi>Eastern Antichriſt.</hi>

                           <hi>Againſt this opinion</hi> it's objected, FIRST <hi>that theſe adverſaries ſhall compaſſe about, or beſiege the Campe of the Saints, and the Beloved-City,</hi> that is, <hi>the Church. But neither the Chriſtians that undertooke that warre, can be understood by the name NATIONS: Neither can theſe Eaſterne Nations, againſt whom the warre was undertaken, be underſtood by the name of SAINTS, or of the Beloved-City.</hi> I anſwer:
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:96676:295"/>The occaſion of the warre is diſtinguiſhed from the warre it ſelfe. The occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion indeed of the <hi>Holy Warre</hi> begun by the Chriſtians, is in this Propheſie ſilently paſſed over: and touching this <hi>it is true what is</hi> objected: but falſe of the warre following thereupon. For it cannot be denyed, that the Eaſterne People being firſt provoked by the Chriſtians, have by Satans impulſion <hi>compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed about the Campe of the Saints</hi> above theſe five hundred yeeres, not ceaſing to trouble the ſame unto this day.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly</hi> it is objected: That the <hi>Gogiſh warre ſhall not begin till the end of the thouſand fatall yeeers: But theſe thouſand yeers are not as yet begun. Anſwer:</hi> The former is true, the latter is falſe: for as we have ſhewed in the foregoing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, thoſe thouſand yeers are expired long agoe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly</hi> they object, <hi>That this Gogiſh warre ſhall continue but a little while: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in ver.</hi> 3. <hi>Satan ſhall be let looſe but for a ſhort ſeaſon. I Anſwer:</hi> Its a falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, <hi>figurae dictionis</hi> (as it is termed:) for the time of Satans looſing is called a <hi>ſhort,</hi> or <hi>little ſeaſon,</hi> not that it ſhall be but for few yeers (for ſo great a warre cannot be undertaken and finiſhed in a little time) but in reſpect of the <hi>thouſand yeeres,</hi> then which it ſhall be ſhorter, becauſe God for the Elects ſake, will ſhorten thoſe dayes: of which ſee more ver. 3. Wherefore the <hi>Gogiſh warre</hi> (as undoubtedly it ſeems) is not indeed that very ſame <hi>Holy Warre</hi> raiſed in Syria by <hi>Hildebrand</hi> and <hi>Turbanus</hi> Romiſh Pontifes: but the TVRKISH WARRE againſt Chriſtendome, which aroſe a while after out of the other, and continueth unto this day: The Cataſtrophe or iſſue whereof now followeth.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>ND fire came downe</hi>] Here begins the <hi>laſt Act.</hi> The event of the <hi>Gogiſh Warre</hi> ſhall bee joyned with the laſt Iudgement at Chriſts comming: the which is ſet forth by a moſt evident Type. Firſt <hi>ſpecially,</hi> briefly ſhewing what was done to <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> with their Army: and what to the devill, in this and the following verſ. Afterward <hi>generally,</hi> what unto all in the laſt Iudgement, <hi>unto the end of the Chapter.</hi> The <hi>Gogiſh Army</hi> was at length conſumed by fire. It is an alluſion unto the Oracle of Ezechiel 38.22. againſt Gog of old, <hi>I will plead againſt him with peſtilence and with blood, and I will raine upon him and upon his hands, an overflowing raine, and great haile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones, fire and brimſtone:</hi> So here againſt the new Gog, <hi>Fire came downe from God out of Heaven, and devoured them;</hi> by which Phraſe the Scripture uſually ſets forth the wonderfull and horrible Iudgements of God upon the Adverſaries, by which at length the wicked are ſo ſuddenly deſtroyed, and the Church delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of diſtreſſe and oppreſſion, as the Victory cannot be aſcribed but to the Divine Power, as in Pſal. 11.6. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the wicked he ſhall rain ſnares, fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and an horrible tempest ſhall be the portion of their cup.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This ſerves greatly to comfort the Church: for although our ſinnes doe too too much fight againſt us: this Oracle notwithſtanding ſheweth Gods benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to bee ſo great, as wee may undoubtedly believe, that the Turkiſh pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhall ſooner bee overthrowne by the moſt powerfull hand of God from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, then that the Church of Chriſt ſhould be extinguiſhed by the ſame. There are ſome who thinke that this kinde of deſtruction <hi>by fire from Heaven,</hi> ſhall lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally be accompliſhed upon the Adverſaries. But I reſt in the alluſion men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: for as God himſelfe overthrew the enemies from Heaven, when as the ſtrength of the Iewiſh people was nothing to reſiſt the <hi>Aſian Tyrants:</hi> ſo when the power of Chriſtians ſhall be no way able to chaſe away, or overthrow the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh Armies</hi> of the Eaſt, God will ſuddenly as it were reach out his arme from Heaven to fight for the Church, and extinguiſh the adverſaries: if not before, yet certainly at the brightneſſe of Chriſts coming to Iudgement: for untill then, this <hi>Gogiſh war,</hi> as likewiſe that other of Antichriſt, ſhall continue.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>fire therefore comming from Heaven, and devouring the adverſaries,</hi> what ſhall it be, but that <hi>ſharpe ſword</hi> proceeding out of the mouth of Chriſt the Iudge, and killing all the wicked Chap. 19.15.21. that is, that flame of fire,

Among theſe, the firſt ſeemes to be, that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies being <hi>devoured with fire from Heaven,</hi> by and by the devill alſo is ſaid to be <hi>caſt into the Lake of fire.</hi> For it ſeemeth that this ſhall not be till the laſt Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be paſt, which followeth after. This verſe therefore by a certaine Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation cohereth with ver. 14. where Iohn ſaw <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Hell to be cast into the Lake of fire.</hi> Now he joyneth the caſting of the devill next with the ſlaughter of the wicked averſaries, to teach us, that the devill ſhall not goe free for ſeducing the Nations, and raiſing <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> to battle againſt the Church: but at laſt bee puniſhed for his great malice, together with other adverſaries: See alſo 1. Cor. 15.24.25.26.</p>
                     <p>By the <hi>devill</hi> wee cannot with reaſon underſtand any other, then that wicked Spirit himſelfe: for he is the ſame here, who verſe 2. is called the <hi>Dragon,</hi> the <hi>old Serpent</hi> and <hi>Satan.</hi> But the Emperour of the Turks whom BRIGHTMAN
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:96676:296"/>here underſtandeth by the devill, belongs in my Iudgement unto the <hi>Gogiſh ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> devoured with fire from Heaven. Satans puniſhment therefore is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by the place, companions, and eternity of his torments. The place of his puniſhment ſhall not bee ſimply the <hi>Pit,</hi> in which he was before <hi>ſhut up a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeers,</hi> but the very ſinke of the bottomleſſe Pit, the Lake of fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, into which he ſhall be caſt by Chriſt the Iudge. It is a <hi>Periphraſis</hi> of hell, which the Scripture ſets forth by the place of torments, unquencheable fire, the worme that dies not, utter darkeneſſe, weeping and gnaſhing of teeth, and ſuch like horrible Epithites, to terrifie the wicked: ſignifying, that the torments of Satan and the ungodly in hell ſhall be unutterable, like as the glory of Chriſt and the Saints in Heaven ſhall bee unſpeakeable. Now of the Lake of Fire and Brimſtone hath beene ſpoken Chap. 19, 20. unto which place <hi>Iohn</hi> ſends us backe, ſaying:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Where the Beaſt and the Falſe-prophet are</hi>] For hee there ſaith that theſe were caſt into this Lake. The devill therefore ſhall find them there as his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in torments: The <hi>Romane Antichriſt,</hi> I ſay, with his <hi>Cardinals,</hi> Vaſſals, and Followers. Theſe ſhall bee caſt into the Lake before the devill: for he ſhall finde them there: yet both ſhall be done in the laſt Iudgement, as Chriſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it in the Goſpell: <hi>depart from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire, which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the devill and his Angels.</hi>

Laſtly he ſaw the <hi>Devill, Death,</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> which are the laſt Enemies, to be caſt with all reprobates into the Lake of Fire: which certainely ſhall not come to paſſe but in the laſt Iudgement, when the Iudge ſhall ſay unto all theſe: <hi>Goe ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devill and his Angels.</hi> Neither ought we to ſeek an Allegorie in circumſtances ſo manifeſtly agreeing with the Evangelicall Hiſtory, becauſe it cannot here have place: foraſmuch as all things are ſutable unto the proper deſcription of the laſt Iudgement, expreſſed in both Teſtaments.</p>
                     <p>Beſides our method confirmes the ſame, by which it hath hitherto bin ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that every one of the Viſions, (the firſt excepted, which was ſpeciall) doth end in the deſcription of the laſt Iudgement, either openly or covertly: the which why it ſhould ſo often be iterated in this Booke, cannot be explicated by them who give no heed unto the diſtinct Acts of the ſeverall Viſions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Adde to this,</hi> that all Interpreters (whom I have ſeen) both old and new are unnanimouſly minded: that here is figured out the caſting of all the adverſaries into eternall puniſhment: and the placing of the godly in everlaſting glory, which ſhall be accompliſhed in the laſt Iudgement.</p>
                     <p>Brightman alone leaving this expoſition, interprets the whole,
<note place="margin">Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie.</note> Allegorically of the full reſtitution of the Iewiſh Nation, which he thinkes ſhall come to paſſe after the Dragon is caſt into the Lake of fire, that is, after the deſtruction of the Turkiſh Emperour and Empire: This hee ſuppoſeth ſhall be about the yeere 1690. moved hereunto by a conjecture too obſcure and uncertaine, from a place in Dan. 12.12. the which how far different a ſenſe it beareth: I ſhall not at this time (for brevity ſake) ſtand to demonſtrate.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But the reaſons,</hi> which he oppoſeth to the received and manifeſt trueth, to me indeed ſeem to have little or no waight in them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He ſaith,</hi> that the following deſcription agrees not unto the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> in Heaven, but to that on Earth only, <hi>in that</hi> the Holy City is ſaid to deſcend from Heaven: <hi>that</hi> the Bride is prepared and adorned for her Huſband, not yet deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered: <hi>that</hi> in ver. 7. the reward is put off till afterward:
<note place="margin">Whether the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the new Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to the Church Militant.</note> 
                        <hi>that</hi> one of the ſeven Angels ſheweth all theſe things to Iohn, whereas there ſhall be no ſuch miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in Heaven: <hi>that</hi> the Apoſtles are ſaid to lay the foundation of the wall of the <hi>the holy City,</hi> whereas rather that belongs to Chriſt: Laſtly <hi>that the Kings of the Earth</hi> are ſaid to <hi>bring their glory</hi> unto this Citie, ver. 24. and that in it ſhall be medicine for the <hi>Nations:</hi> which things are not to be underſtood of Heaven, but of the Earth.</p>
                     <p>But there is nothing here touching theſe things, which may not eaſily be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied unto the ſtate of the glorified Church, if wee well minde the ſcope of the Allegoricall Viſion, and obſerve other things, which doe not at all agree with the ſtate of the Church here on Earth, as we ſhall ſhew in its place. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely the glory of the Church ſhall never be ſo great in this life, as to bee alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without <hi>tares,</hi> that there ſhould bee none in her but Elected Ones, that ſhe ſhould be ſtained with no ſcandals and feined Chriſtians: in a word that there ſhould be <hi>no Temple,</hi> nor Sun ſhining in her, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>He ſaith <hi>ſecondly</hi> that the vocation of the Iews unto the Church,
<note place="margin">Whether this Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead be the calling of the Iews.</note> is in Scripture often called a Reſurrection of the dead, as Rom. 11.15. <hi>for if the caſting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what ſhall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead,</hi> Iſa 26.19. <hi>Thy dead men ſhall live, my Carkaſſes ſhall riſe againe,</hi> &amp;c. Ezech. 37.12. <hi>I will open your graves, O my People, and cauſe you to come up out of your graves.</hi> &amp;c. Dan. 12.2.3. <hi>And many of them that ſleepe in the dust of the
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:96676:297"/>Earth ſhall awake, ſome to everlasting Life, and ſome to ſhame and everlaſting tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Hoſea 13.14. <hi>I will ranſome them from the power of the grave: I will redeeme them from death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But verily it would bee a long worke for him to prove that theſe places of Scripture, the firſt excepted, doe at all belong to the calling of the Iews, ſeeing <hi>Some</hi> doe manifeſtly ſpeake of their deliverance out of Babylon: <hi>Others</hi> of the Spirituall Redemption of the whole Church by Chriſt: <hi>Others</hi> of the laſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the body. Onely the Teſtimony of the Apoſtle is to the matter, but proves nothing. For neither doth it follow from the particular: becauſe there the converſion of the Iewes is called a <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> therefore here alſo. There the thing is cleare: here not ſo. Nay here is no mention of a Reſurrection, but it is ſet forth under other figures. And all the circumſtances doe moſt evidently repreſent the Type of the laſt Iudgement.</p>

Now he ſeeth the guilty ſtanding before the Iudgement Seat: whom hee deſcribeth, <hi>Firſt</hi> from their former ſtate, by calling them <hi>The dead,</hi> after the common Law of nature, but then raiſed from death to life by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God: he ſpeaks not of men dead in ſins, as in <hi>ver.</hi> 5. but of ſuch as dyed cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally, and now were raiſed up to Iudgement.

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly he deſcribes them from their age and condition: for the words may be underſtood of both: <hi>Great and Small</hi>] That is, as well the powerfull Tyrants of the world, Emperours, Kings, Princes, and Great men: as Subjects and men of low condition: Or properly, <hi>Great</hi> in Age and ſtature, that is, growne men and women: <hi>Small</hi> alſo, that is, dying in their child-hood: by this partition he ſheweth that all and every one without any exception are to be judged: for the Iudgement ſhall be univerſall: no man ſhall bee ſo <hi>Great</hi> as to eſcape the ſame: none ſo <hi>ſmall</hi> as to be excluded,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10</note> but every one ſhall have right without reſpect of perſons, as the Apoſtle witneſſeth: <hi>We muſt all appeare before the Iudgement Seat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</hi>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd I ſaw a new Heaven</hi>] We have heard of one part of the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt Iudgement, <hi>viz.</hi> the caſting of the Adverſaries into torments:
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Lib.</hi> 20. <hi>de C. D. c.</hi> 16.</note> 
                        <hi>In which,</hi> ſaith AVSTIN, <hi>he declared what was briefly ſpoken by the LORD: And theſe ſhall go into everlaſting puniſhment.</hi> Now followes the ſecond part, the placing of the Elect in glory, in which alſo is expounded, what Chriſt there addeth: <hi>And the just into life everlaſting.</hi> As the former did ſerve to ſtrike a terrour into the ungodly, ſo the latter to leſſen the fear and ſorrow of the godly, and ſtir them up to alacrity and joy. For ſeeing the Saints in this life are compaſſed about with innumerable calamities &amp; miſeries: no wonder though they ſhould weare away with continuall ſorrow and mourning. But in this part of the Viſion, they are ſtrengthned in their hope. For at laſt there ſhalbe a change of all things, an end of all adverſitie, abundance of all good, as Chriſt ſaid:
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.20.</note> 
                        <hi>Yee ſhall lament and mourn, but your mourning ſhalbe turned into joy.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The new Ieruſalem is not the Church mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant: much leſſe the Church of Rome. How farre Alcaſars o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is approvable.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wherefore after the wicked were judged, <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw <hi>a new Heaven and a new Earth.</hi> Afterward a <hi>new Ieruſalem</hi> gliſtering with gold and pretious ſtones. That this latter is wholly allegoricall, cannot be queſtioned by any: although it be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly expounded: For ſome ſay it ſhadows out the magnificence of the Church Militant, much ſpoken of by the Prophets: yea there are ſome, who ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially applie it to the glory of the Romane Church in this world.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Alcaſar</hi> reproves both juſtly, and giveth reaſons that the <hi>Viſion</hi> of the two Chapters is proper to the Church Triumphant. Notwithſtanding afterward fooliſhly contendeth that it is to be applied in ſpeciall unto the glory of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church</hi> in Heaven. Now this he doth not becauſe hee thought it to bee true: but to flatter the Pope (it may be for the <hi>Cardinals hat</hi> ſake) and vex the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, as he pretendeth. Which now I paſſe by.</p>
                     <p>Now to returne to the <hi>former</hi> againe,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Touching the new heaven and the new earth.</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17</note> touching the <hi>new Heaven</hi> and <hi>the new Earth,</hi> whither it be allegorically, or properly to be underſtood.</p>
                     <p>Some underſtand it <hi>allegorically</hi> of the renewing of the world by Chriſt, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching which the Apoſtle. <hi>If any one be in Chriſt, he is a new creature. Old things are past away, Behold</hi> I <hi>make all things new.</hi> This Spirituall renovation began e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from the preaching of the Apoſtles: and is undoubtedly an alluſion unto the
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:96676:301"/>Propheſie of Iſaias:
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.17.</note> 
                        <hi>Behold</hi> I <hi>create new heavens and a new earth,</hi> &amp;c. which ſeems to be ſpoken of the new ſtate of the Church in the Kingdom of Chriſt on earth: and ſo BRIGHTMAN, as I have ſhewed, interprets it metaphorically of the renewed ſtate of the Church, through the converſion of the Iewes, ſhortly to be accompliſhed.</p>
                     <p>But all theſe things cannot without violence be applied unto the ſtate of the Church on earth. The <hi>Chiliaſts</hi> indeed applied it unto that <hi>golden age,</hi> in which they dreamt they ſhould voluptuouſly reigne <hi>a thouſand yeeres</hi> with Chriſt on earth. <hi>But</hi> this opinion is repugnant to the praedictions of Chriſt and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, that the ſtate of the Church in the laſt times, ſhall not bee voluptuous or joyfull at all, but ſad and mournfull, as above we ſhewed.</p>
                     <p>Therefore we are rather to underſtand the <hi>former</hi> touching the <hi>new heaven</hi> and <hi>the new earth</hi> properly:
<note place="margin">What is meane by the new heaven &amp; the new earth.</note> for it is ſo evident, that here is treated of the laſt Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the conſequents thereof, as it can ſcarcely be doubted of. So that this <hi>new heaven</hi> and this <hi>new earth,</hi> which Iohn ſaw after the judgement of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, is <hi>that new heaven,</hi> and <hi>that new earth,</hi> which as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> expreſly foretold,
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3; 10</note> is to be expected after the burning of the world: <hi>For theſe heavens ſhall paſſe away with a great noyſe, and the Elements ſhall melt with ſervent heat, the earth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo and the works that are therein ſhall be burnt up: But we according to the promiſe looke for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteouſneſſe.</hi> By which plainly we gather that a <hi>new heaven</hi> and <hi>a new earth</hi> is to bee looked for Hiſtorically and properly, and here likewiſe it is ſo to be underſtood.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hence alſo</hi> it followeth: that the Oracle of <hi>Iſaias</hi> touching the <hi>new heaven</hi> and <hi>the new earth</hi> is to be underſtood not onely metaphorically of the renewed ſtate of the <hi>Church</hi> on earth, but litterally alſo of the renovation of the world, which ſhall be at the laſt day. For <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith that <hi>wee looke for a new heaven and a new earth according to the promiſe.</hi> Now this <hi>promiſe</hi> is no where elſe but in Iſa. 65.17. &amp; 66.22. Therefore undoubtedly God by the Prophet ſpeakes not onely of the inchoated ſpirituall renovation which is in this life, but alſo of the conſummated litterall and proper renovation, which we look for at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Now the <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>the Earth</hi> ſhall not bee new in Subſtance,
<note place="margin">How hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth are new.</note> but in Qualities, as puritie, brightneſſe, and glory: for that which is added: <hi>The firſt heaven and the firſt earth are paſſed away:</hi> and before Chap. 20.11. <hi>From whoſe face the heaven and the earth,</hi> &amp;c. doth not ſignifie, that they ſhould bee brought to nothing, but that they are to be purifyed by fire from all preſent vanity and defilement.</p>
                     <p>So <hi>Peter</hi> interpreteth the ſame: <hi>The heavens burning ſhall be diſſolved, and the Elements ſhall melt with fervent heat.</hi> Whence the Apoſtle gathers this weighty inſtruction: <hi>ſeeing that all theſe things ſhall be diſſolved, what manner of men ought yee to bee in all holy converſation and godlineſſe?</hi> And indeed to meditate, and doe this, tends more to Salvation, then curiouſly to ſearch after the manner of the Renovation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Now if any one</hi> ſhould ſay: Theſe things <hi>John</hi> ſaw: but the Heavenly glory, <hi>Eye hath not ſeene, Eare hath not heard,</hi> &amp;c. therefore the <hi>Viſion</hi> ſpeakes not of this glory: The <hi>anſwer</hi> is eaſie. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw not the thing it ſelfe: but he ſaw cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine repreſentations and types of the things to come. Therefore it remaines true, that <hi>Eye hath not ſeene,</hi> &amp;c. eſpecially ſeeing <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw not the ſame with his eyes, but in the ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And the Sea was no more</hi>] AVGVSTINE thinkes that the <hi>Sea</hi> may be underſtood of the turbulent world,

<note place="margin">The reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Sea.</note> for what uſe ſhould there be of it, ſeeing then men ſhall ſaile no more. <hi>Schoole-men</hi> thinke that the <hi>Sea</hi> ſhall ſo bee renewed, as indeed it ſhall not retaine its ſubſtance: becauſe the water is to be conſolidated into the globe of the Sphere, remaining no longer flowing: But theſe curioſities we leave unto themſelves.</p>
                     <p>By the <hi>New Heaven</hi> BRIHGTMAN underſtands a new worſhip and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in godlineſſe: By the <hi>new earth,</hi> new Iſraelites, which then ſhall joyne unto the Church of Chriſt: By the <hi>former heaven</hi> that paſſed away, the <hi>Iewiſh worſhip</hi> which they ſhall no longer exerciſe: By the <hi>former earth</hi> the Iewes themſelves, who of Iewes, ſhall become Chriſtians: By the <hi>Sea,</hi> which was no more, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt doctrine which ſhall have no place among the new people: for then the Iewes ſhall caſt off their errours touching the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> which now they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine tooth and naile, &amp;c. What manner of Allegories theſe are, I paſſe by, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely they depend upon a very improbable conjecture, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Eaſterne Iewes after the overthrow of the <hi>Turkiſh Empire</hi> and burning of Rome, ſhould be added unto the Church of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>And I Iohn ſaw the holy City</hi>] Now alſo the glory of the renewed Church is exhibited to the view of <hi>Iohn,</hi> under the Type of a <hi>moſt beautifull Citie,</hi> as it were a <hi>Bride</hi> moſt curiouſly adorned.

                        <hi>to ſee the judgement of the great whore ſitting upon the Beaſt.</hi> What things he there ſaw and heard, he hath declared at large. Now that ſame Angell being one of the ſeven Pourers forth of the Vials, (for I underſtand it of the ſelfe ſame, who ſeemed, as above I ſaid, to be the ſeventh, pouring out the laſt Viall into the Aire, and proclaiming the end of the world) <hi>comes unto Iohn</hi>] that is, returnes unto him, (for undoubtedly he had turned aſide) and as before he had ſaid: <hi>Come hither,

                     <p>
                        <hi>Like a Jaſper ſtone</hi>] This is a moſt noble Gemme, of it are divers ſorts, of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent vertue:

It ſheweth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the <hi>light of this Citie</hi> is not onely healthfull, diſpelling all poyſonous and hurtfull things: but alſo moſt bright. Why doth he not liken it to the Sunne? This Citie ſhall have neither Sunne nor Moon, but that which is clearer then the ſame: Perhaps alſo, becauſe the heat of the Sun is troubleſome: the coldneſſe of the Moone is uſually hurtfull to the body, but here ſhall bee nothing either troubleſome or hurtfull.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. <hi>And had a wall</hi>] Now he deſcribes the parts of the Citie moſt obvious to the ſight, externall and internall. Hee begins with the <hi>wall,</hi> compaſſing the ſtreets about: for it is convenient that a Citie bee invironed and fortified with <hi>wals,</hi> that the lives and eſtates of the Citizens may be preſerved from the incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:96676:306"/>of adverſaries and wild Beaſts. For wals are called <hi>Mania a muniendo</hi> of fortifying. Theſe muſt be high, thicke, and ſtrong. Such was this <hi>wall:</hi> great in thickeneſſe, and very high: as in ver. 17. ANDREAS ſaith: <hi>By this wall, we may understand the hedge of Gods ſafeguard and protection.</hi> Wherefore it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, that the life and ſafety of the glorified Church is ſure, and in no danger of externall force or hurt: becauſe the wall of Gods omnipotencie defendeth and keepeth the Citie. But it will not hence follow, ſeeing the ſafety of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Church is out of all danger, that therefore there is no need of this <hi>wall.</hi> For this very ſecurity is here ſignified by the Allegory of a <hi>wall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And twelve gates</hi>] In the wall, gates are made, for the Citizens and others to go out and in. This <hi>wall</hi> hath <hi>twelve gates,</hi> excellently placed, guarded, and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. For all the <hi>gates</hi> have Guardians to keep them, not men, but Angels, who are watchfull, ſtrong, and unwearied. <hi>Every one</hi> hath Emblems written on it: <hi>the names of the twelve Tribes of Iſrael:</hi> Three gates are ordered unto the ſeverall corners of the world: that there might bee moſt eaſie acceſſe from all parts unto the ſame.</p>
                     <p>By the <hi>Gates</hi> they underſtand the doctrine of the Goſpell, by which Heaven is opend unto us: by the <hi>Angels,</hi> the Patriarchs, Prophets, and Apoſtles: who by their preaching have ſhewed us the way to Heaven: and doe all belong unto this Citie. By the <hi>names of the twelve Tribes written thereon,</hi> they underſtand the full gathering of al the Elect of the Spirituall Iſrael into the ſame. <hi>Three gates</hi> ſtand towards the Eaſt, <hi>three</hi> to the North, &amp;c. becauſe this Church is gathered from all parts of the world.</p>
                     <p>Whether by the number of the <hi>Gates</hi> (being three on each ſide of the wall) bee a myſterie of the Trinitie (as <hi>Andreas</hi> ſuppoſeth) I neither know, nor date affirme: leaſt according to the number of the <hi>Gates,</hi> the number of the divine perſons ſhould be alſo multiplied. It is more agreeable to obſerve here an Allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion unto the type of the <hi>holy Citie</hi> deſcribed by <hi>Ezechiel, Chap.</hi> 48.30. for that alſo had <hi>twelve gates,</hi> named after the Tribes of Iſrael, <hi>viz.</hi> Three gates North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: <hi>One of Reuben, one of Judah, one of Levi.</hi> Three Eaſtward: <hi>One of Ioſeph, one of Benjamin, one of Dan.</hi> Three at the South: <hi>One of Simeon, one of Iſſachar, one of Zebulon.</hi> Three Weſtward: <hi>One of Gad, one of Aſher, one of Naphthali.</hi> Now that <hi>Citie</hi> repreſents the Church Militant of the New Teſtament, becauſe all the Tribes of the ſpirituall Iſrael, that is, all the Elect from al the corners of the Earth were to be gathered unto the ſame. Such alſo in this place is the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the Church Triumphant in Heaven.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. <hi>And the wall of the City</hi>] He commends the ſtrength of the <hi>wall</hi> from the foundations, on which it was built. For without a firme foundation a wall is ruinous, and muſt needs decay. The <hi>foundations</hi> he ſaith are <hi>twelve,</hi> the preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous materials whereof, are expounded <hi>ver.</hi> 19. to wit, ſo many pretious ſtones, moſt firmely ſuſtaining this <hi>wall,</hi> and having the Names of the Apoſtles in them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But</hi> Chriſt is the onely foundation, holding, and keeping up the Church:
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11</note> 
                        <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any other be laid,</hi> &amp;c. How then are the Apoſtles foundations? And if the Apoſtles be foundations, then ſaith BRIGHTMAN, this is not that <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Citie in the Heavens. I Anſwer:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Why the names of the Apoſtles are written in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.</note> Iohn ſaith not that the Apoſtles are foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations. But that the names of the Apoſtles were written or graven on the <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,</hi> that is, they were called after the names of the Apoſtles, one being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Peters,</hi> another <hi>Iohns,</hi> &amp;c. Why ſo? for honour ſake, becauſe the Apoſtles in this Citie ſhall excell others in glory. But why written in the foundations? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they by their preaching laid the onely foundation, which is Chriſt. For what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelfe: <hi>As a wiſe Maſter-builder I have laid the foundation:</hi> that every one of them could ſay alſo of himſelfe. Which is the reaſon, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the foundation bee but one, yet he ſaith they are <hi>twelve,</hi> according to the number of the twelve Apoſtles, becauſe that one <hi>Foundation</hi> was ſo fully laid by
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:96676:307"/>every one of them,
<note place="margin">How there are twelve foundations</note> as there might ſeem to be twelve foundations, the ſame being as it were laid twelve times, or by the twelve Apoſtles.</p>
                     <p>But why is <hi>Paul</hi> omitted, ſeeing he laboured more then the twelve? Becauſe at firſt CHRIST choſe <hi>twelve</hi> onely, unto whom Paul was afterward added, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming as it were into the labours of the reſt. But ſeeing the <hi>names</hi> are not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, no one of the Apoſtles can be ſaid to be omitted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Of the Apoſtles of the Lambe</hi>] Or of Ieſus Chriſt: for ſo the Apoſtles ſtile themſelves in their Epiſtles.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. <hi>And he that talked</hi>] Now alſo he deſcribes the moſt ample and abſolute figure of the <hi>Citie:</hi> firſt ſhewing, whence he received the exact knowledge ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: <hi>viz.</hi> from the Angels meaſuring.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He that talked with me</hi>] That is, one of the Angels of the <hi>ſeven Vials,</hi> who had ſaid before unto me, <hi>Come hither, I will ſhew thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Had</hi> (in his hand) <hi>a golden Reed</hi>] That is a meaſuring Inſtrument to mete the <hi>wall</hi> and <hi>gates,</hi> like as Maſter-builders uſe to examine the whole building by a meaſuring rule, whither all things do well agree. Now the end of meaſuring was to make known the quantitie, ſo as <hi>Iohn</hi> might preciſely underſtand and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe unto us the moſt abſolute figure of this myſticall City. This alſo is taken out of Ezech. 40.5. where the Prophet ſaw the <hi>Architect Angell</hi> of the Church, that is, Chriſt with <hi>a meaſuring Reed</hi> of <hi>ſix Cubits and foure fingers, to meaſure the Court of the new Temple,</hi> and of the ſituation, and of the City.</p>
                     <p n="16">16.
<note place="margin">The City is juſt foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquare.</note> 
                        <hi>And the Citie lyeth foure-ſquare</hi>] The City he deſcribeth to be juſt foure ſquare: which kind of forme is moſt ſolid, conſtant, and perfect: becauſe the longitude and latitude of all the parts is equall: for this Citie equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth of all the Elect: wherefore hee denotes the immoveable firmeneſſe of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The quantitie</hi> is 12000. <hi>Furlongs,</hi> which make 375. Germane miles. It is am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous, whether this were the meaſure of the whole Circumference: or of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the ſides or ſquares of the Citie: If of the ſides, then the Circumference was 48000. <hi>Furlongs,</hi> that is, 1500. Germane miles: but the whole Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ſeemes to be noted: ſo that every ſide contained 300. <hi>Furlongs,</hi> that is, 93. Germane miles and three quarters.</p>
                     <p>Therefore this <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> is far greater then Babylon of old,
<note place="margin">The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.</note> which as <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> deſcribeth was foure ſquare, in Circumference 480. Furlongs, that is, fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene Germane miles: each ſide 120. Furlongs, that is, three Germane miles and three quarters. It had alſo a great and high wall, fiftie royall Cubits in thicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and two hundred in height, of Brick ſtone and morter. But this City is much more magnificent and ſtrong. For <hi>Babylon</hi> was taken by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> by <hi>Alexander,</hi> and ſpoiled by divers adverſaries. But this is inacceſſible, and cannot be vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by any enemy, but remaines ſtable for ever.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. <hi>And he meaſured the wall thereof</hi>] Thus much of the Cities Circumference: The meaſure of the <hi>wall</hi> was 144. <hi>Cubits.</hi> Therefore hee rightly cals it a <hi>high wall,</hi> which no adverſe power can eaſily overcome. Hereby, ſaith <hi>Andreas,</hi> is ſignified the fruitfulneſſe of the doctrine of the Apoſtles: for the meaſure of the wall is made up by multiplying the twelve Apoſtles by 12. A <hi>Cubit</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly is from the Elbow unto the fingers end: hence the meaſure of a <hi>Cubit,</hi> is ſixe hand-breadths or 24. fingers. So much is the common Cubit. The <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Cubit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Herodotus</hi> exceeded the common by three fingers.

                     <p>But verily, ſeeing there is no certaine order of the Apoſtles ſet downe in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Writ, this labour of his is frivolous: Neither was the Angell troubled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſame: but counted it ſufficient to name every one of the foundations by ſeverall ſtones.</p>
                     <p>BRIGHTMAN ſheweth another myſterie in the pretious ſtones: for hee thinkes that by them are denoted, not the twelve Apoſtles, but ſo many <hi>Iewiſh Doctors,</hi> who ſhall become Teachers of the Chriſtian Church, and beare the names of the Apoſtles, becauſe they ſhall ſucceed them in number and ſociety of rewards: and that generally the common excellency of the gemmes ſhadowes out the dignity of thoſe Evangelicall Doctors: But that the ſeverall gemmes ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie in what Regions and Places theſe Preachers of the Goſpell ſhould ſeverally ariſe, like as pretious ſtones grow in divers places: ſome in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> ſome in the <hi>Indies,</hi> others in <hi>Scythia,</hi> or in <hi>Perſia,</hi> &amp;c.

The ſenſe is the ſame: for all the ſtreets do lead to the <hi>Market.</hi> The ſtreets and Market-places of a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie are faire, if paved with flint, tyles, and ſmooth ſtones: and yet (by reaſon of continuall uſe) they can never be free from durt. But the ſtreet of this Citie is much more curious. It is all gold, and that moſt purely purged of all droſſe, cleare as glaſſe, like unto the whole Citie, ver. 18.

                     <p>Now hence againe their opinion is overthrowne, who interpret theſe things of the glory of the Church-Militant.

Therefore the whole <hi>Citie</hi> ſhall ſhine continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with the immenſe light of divine majeſty, being ſubject to no change of dayes and nights, which now the continuall riſings and fallings of the Sun and Moone doe effect, ſo as there is no <hi>Citie</hi> in the whole world, no not under the Pole, which hath alwayes light.

                     <p>
                        <hi>I ANSWER:</hi> We muſt indeed confeſſe, that the Prophet ſpeaketh of excellent graces, and of a glorious light of doctrine and knowledge that ſhal be
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:96676:312"/>under Chriſts Kingdome in the Church of the New Teſtament, which light ſhal excell the ſhadowes of the types of the Old Teſtament, like as the glory of God himſelfe ſurpaſſeth the Sun and Moone: ſo it is ſaid figuratively: <hi>The Sun ſhall ſhine no more in thee: nor the Moone give light any longer unto thee: becauſe Iehovah ſhall be thy light for ever:</hi> for: the ſhadowes and types of Sacrifices and Burnt-Offerings ſhalbe no more: becauſe Chriſt being exhibited (who is as it were the Sunne of righteouſneſſe) the <hi>New Church</hi> ſhall ſhine moſt gloriouſly beyond the <hi>Old,</hi> in the knowledge of the Goſpell, and the myſteries of God, by the pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring forth of the light of Gods Spirit upon all fleſh.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But we deny,</hi> that this is the full ſenſe of theſe Propheſies. For the Prophets almoſt in all their Oracles touching Chriſts Kingdome, propheſie not onely of the Inchoation, but alſo of the Conſummation of the glory thereof. Otherwiſe the fulfilling but of very few of them could bee ſhewed in this Life. And this chiefly bewitcheth the Iews: in that they ſeeke and expect a literal accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Propheſies touching the Kingdome of the Meſſias, in this world: not obſerving that the Prophets with the beginnings of this Life, in which the glory of Chriſts Kingdome is onely begun, joyne alſo the full accompliſhment which ſhal be at laſt in the life to come. Therefore the Oracles of <hi>Iſaias</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the <hi>aboliſhing of the light of the Sunne and Moone,</hi> although they bee now fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratively fulfilled: yet the literal accompliſhment thereof ſhal be at laſt in the Church gloriouſly reigning in Heaven: And therefore they are rightly applied unto the illumination of this City in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Neither are the Arguments for this opinion obſcure in the Propheſies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. For ſaith the Prophet: <hi>Iehovah ſhall be upon thee an everlaſting light.</hi> But Everlaſtingneſſe is not of this Life. He ſaith alſo: <hi>The dayes of thy mourning ſhal be ended.</hi> Now the mourning of the Church ſhal not be ended in this Life: but in the Church-Triumphant, where God wil wipe away all teares from our eyes, there, I ſay, ſhal be no longer mourning, nor cry, nor death, nor ſorrow, as in ver. 4.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. <hi>And the Nations that were ſaved</hi>] Thus much of the building and glory of the Citie: Now alſo hee ſpeakes of the Citizens, who they ſhal bee, what good things they ſhall enjoy: and who ſhalbe kept out of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>For the <hi>firſt,</hi> he ſaith, that the INHABITANTS of this Citie ſhall bee, THE NATIONS THAT ARE SAVED: conſiſting not onely of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, but Kings alſo: for he ſaith: <hi>Kings ſhall walke in the light of it,</hi> that is, ſhall eternally enjoy the glorious preſence and majeſty of God:

                     </p>
                     <p>Here firſt it is demaunded if this <hi>Citie</hi> bee the glorified Church, how then are the <hi>Nations</hi> diſtinguiſhed from the ſame, ſeeing the <hi>Nations</hi> that are ſaved, are nothing elſe but the Church it ſelfe?</p>
                     <p>I ANSWER: The order of the <hi>Viſion</hi> is to be obſerved: for ſeeing he ſaw the glorified Church under the forme of a <hi>Citie:</hi> it was convenient that hee ſhould ſee alſo ſome Inhabitants of the Citie. Although therefore the <hi>ſaved of the Nations</hi> be the Church it ſelfe: Notwithſtanding he doth not unfitly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the <hi>Church</hi> taken <hi>collectively;</hi> from the Church it ſelfe <hi>diſtributively</hi> conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: for thus alſo an Earthly Citie may be collectively conſidered, as a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal or communitie of Citizens: and diſtributively as many, or particular Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens. <hi>Adde</hi> to this, that the <hi>Nations</hi> are not the whole City: for the Elect Patriarchs, Prophets, and Iewes belong alſo unto the ſame.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly</hi> it may be demaunded how the <hi>Kings</hi> ſhould <hi>bring their glory into this Heavenly Citie,</hi> ſeeing all Authorities, Kingdomes,

                        </note> and Powers ſhall then be put downe: and that there ſhalbe no <hi>Kings</hi> then: and that in the Heavenly City, no earthly thing can be brought: Laſtly, ſeeing all ſhal rather receive their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry there, then bring any into it? <hi>Which</hi> ſeemeth to be the chiefeſt argument of them who hold that here is intended not the Heauenly, but the Earthly
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:96676:313"/>glory of the CHURCH in this Life. The Anſwer is eaſie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> we are to note that this verſe alſo is taken out of Iſai. 60.3. <hi>And the Gentiles,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall come to thy light, and Kings to the brightneſſe of thy riſing:</hi> the which is ſpoken indeed of the converſion of the Gentiles and Heatheniſh Kings. <hi>But,</hi> as before I ſaid, that whole Oracle ſpeaketh not onely of the inchoated glory of the Church in this Life, but with the beginning joynes the full accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment thereof that ſhalbe in the Heavens: as there it evidently appeareth in ver. 11.18.19.21. Wherefore that place is to be applied unto the Heavenly Citie, not as it began in this Life, but as it ſhall be at laſt conſummated in the life to come. And the meaning is, that then that oracle ſhall truely and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bee fulfilled, when as the <hi>Nations that are ſaved,</hi> ſhall walke perfectly in the <hi>light of Jehovah:</hi> And that the KINGS alſo who in this life have brought their glory and honour into the Church, that is, ſubjected themſelves unto Chriſt, ſhal enjoy the ſame light for ever and ever.</p>
                     <p>Therefore he intendeth not as if then there ſhould be any Earthly Kings, to bring their earthly glory into heaven (for we ſhal al be Kings and Prieſts to God) but that the Kings which now bring their glory to Chriſt, ſhall together with the Nations walke in the <hi>light.</hi> This ſenſe is confirmed by the Participle <gap reason="foreign">

For in <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.16. it appeareth, that ſome (if not all) <hi>of the ten Kings of the earth which had given their power unto the Beaſt,</hi> ſhould deſert the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> eat the fleſh of the <hi>whore,</hi> and burne her with fire: therefore ſome of them ſhalbe converted unto the <hi>Lambe,</hi> and with the Nations that are ſaved ſhall walke in the light of this Citie.</p>
                     <p n="25">25.
<note place="margin">The ſignes of aſſured peace.</note> 
                        <hi>And the gates of it ſhall not be ſhut</hi>] This is the Second Part, <hi>viz.</hi> the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity and firme peace of the Citizens: the which while Cities enjoy they flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in riches and glory: but the peace, tranquility, and ſecurity of this City ſhal be perfect and perpetuall.</p>
                     <p>This he ſheweth by two ſignes: <hi>One</hi> is,, becauſe <hi>the gates ſhall not be ſhut by day.</hi> But thou wilt ſay, the gates of our Cities alſo are not ſhut by day. It is ſo indeed in time of peace: but in war, the enemy beſieging a City, and labouring to break in, of neceſſity the gates muſt be ſhut, that the Citizens may be preſerved from hoſtile invaſion. But the <hi>gates</hi> of the <hi>Citie on high</hi> ſhal not be ſhut by day, but alwayes ſtand open: to ſignifie that there ſhalbe no danger of adverſaries, but everlaſting peace to the Citizens thereof.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For there ſhall be no night there</hi>] This is the other ſign of their everlaſting peace. For in the night while the Citizens ſleep, the gates are ſhut, leaſt they ſhould be ſet upon unawares in the dark. <hi>There ſhall be no night:</hi> becauſe the glory of God ſhal expell the darkneſſe by everlaſting light, ſo that the riſing, or ſetting of the Sun or Moon ſhal not cauſe night or darkneſſe. Therefore the Citizens ſhal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſleep, or ſhut their gates for fear of danger. Theſe things being ſpoken after the manner of men, do in ſome ſort ſhadow out unto us that eternall ſecurity and peace, which we ſhal enjoy in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>To this alſo is applied out of <hi>Iſaias,</hi> the 11. ver. of the ſaid 60. <hi>Chap.</hi> (though there ſpoken in a ſenſe ſomewhat different from what it is here) <hi>Therefore thy gates ſhalbe open continually, they ſhall not be ſhut day nor night, that they may bring unto thee
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:96676:314"/>the forces of the Gentiles, and their Kings may bee brought:</hi> where is ſignified ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe of not ſhutting the gates, then here. Here it ſhalbe of ſecurity: There for the exerciſing of ſpirituall trading night and day, that is, for the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of all Nations, and the Kings of the Nations unto Chriſts kingdom; <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the gates ſhall not be ſhut,</hi> that is, no man ſhal be kept out of the Church: <hi>but they ſhall alwayes stand open,</hi> that is, all men ſhal be called unto the Church by the preaching of the Goſpell. Whence it is evident, that the Propheſie there ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth properly of the ſtate of the Church-Militant: and that the ſame is here ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied unto the ſecurity of the Church-Triumphant.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. <hi>And they ſhall bring the glory and honour of the Nations unto it</hi>] What in ver. 24. he had ſaid of the <hi>Kings</hi> onely, he extends unto all Nations, <hi>viz.</hi> that hither they ſhould bring their glory and honour. <hi>They ſhall bring the glory of the Nations,</hi> for, the <hi>Nations</hi> ſhal bring their glory. By an <hi>Hebraiſm,</hi> he nameth the GLORIE AND HONOUR OF THE NATIONS, for the Nations that ſhalbe glorified, which then ſhal walk in the light of this City.</p>
                     <p>Which again makes nothing for the Church-Militant, unto which indeed the Nations do bring their glory, that is, ſubject their wealth, Cities, Provinces, and Kingdoms to Chriſt. But by doing of it in this life, they alſo bring the ſame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Heavenly City: becauſe for this Earthly glory they ſhall receive Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly glory.</p>
                     <p>Now this alſo is taken out of Iſa. 6. ver. 11. and therefore is to be applied in the ſame ſenſe as the former, unto the Coeleſtial Citie.</p>
                     <p n="27">27. <hi>And there ſhall in no wiſe enter into it any thing that defileth</hi>] This is the <hi>Third:</hi> who are to be kept out of the Citie, as enemies and unworthy Inhabitants: who on the contrary are to be admitted, as worthy dwellers.</p>
                     <p>There are three ſorts of men to be kept out: <hi>Defiled ones, Workers of abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Lyars,</hi> they being ſuch, as in ver. 8. he had ſaid ſhould bee caſt into the Lake of Fire: namely, <hi>the fearfull, unbeleeving, murderers, whoremongers, ſorcerers, Idolaters, and all lyars:</hi> Of whom we there ſpake: neither is the reaſon obſcure, why theſe ſhould have no entrance: for all ſuch perſons are excluded out of the kingdom of God in this life, by the expreſſe voyce of the Goſpel: <hi>Be not deceived:
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9.</note> neither Fornicatours, nor Idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abuſers of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor reviſers, nor extortio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16</note> Becauſe therefore Chriſt will judge accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Goſpell of Paul, all theſe ſhall not onely be kept out of the Heavenly City, but alſo by the Judge his ſentence be caſt into the lake of fire.</p>
                     <p>Now this alſo is contrary to the opinion touching the Church-Militant: for much defilement enters in it, and many dregs have as yet their influence there: foraſmuch as the Church of the called is a <hi>Field mixt with wheat and tares,</hi> a <hi>floore</hi> containing <hi>chaffe and wheat, a not drawing good and bad fiſh.</hi> But the purity and perfect cleanneſſe of this City, altogether agrees to the ſtate of the Saints in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But they which are written in the Lambs Book of Life</hi>] That is, the elect onely, and faithful that are borne again in this life ſhall enter into the City above. See our Expoſition on Chap. 3.5. &amp; 13.8. &amp; 17.8. &amp; 20.15.</p>

                     <hi>THe</hi> Heavenly Citie <hi>he further commendeth by the River of</hi> living water <hi>running through it, and by the</hi> tree of Life, <hi>allwayes bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring fruit, and ſtanding in the midſt of the ſtreet, and on either ſide of the River: Laſtly by the Seat of God and the Lambe in the ſame, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by the happineſſe and eternall glory of the Inhabitants thereof. At length hee concludes the whole Propheſie by a short recapitulation of the things hitherto ſpoken, and by the commendation of much profit thence flowing unto the godly, as alſo by eſtablishing the inviolable Authority of this Booke.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>In the former are foure commendations of the City.
<list>
                        <item>I. <hi>The pleaſantneſſe,</hi> by the running River: the excellency whereof he commendeth <hi>both</hi> by the purity of the waters, <hi>as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi> by its originall, ver. 1. <hi>A River of water,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>proceeding out of the throne,</hi> &amp;c.</item>
                        <item>II. <hi>The fruitfulneſſe and abundance</hi> of neceſſaries from the <hi>tree of life:</hi> whoſe ſeat or place he <hi>firſt</hi> deſcribeth: <hi>In the midſt of the ſtreet, and of either ſide of the River,</hi> ver. 2. <hi>Secondly</hi> he commends the fruit both from the abundance: <hi>It beares twelve manner of fruits:</hi> as <hi>alſo,</hi> from its continuall bearing: <hi>Every moneth. Thirdly</hi> hee praiſeth the leaves by the excellency of their effects: <hi>for</hi> healing, &amp;c.</item>
                        <item>III. <hi>The puritie and majeſty of the Citie: both</hi> by removing of all corrupting cauſes: <hi>There ſhall be no curſe in it,</hi> ver. 3. Neither <hi>night or darkneſſe,</hi> ver. 5. as <hi>alſo</hi> by an expoſition of the great majeſty, becauſe it ſhall be the throne of God and the Lambe: and becauſe his ſervants ſhall ſerve this great majeſty, ver. 3.</item>
                        <item>IV. <hi>The eternall felicity of the Citizens.</hi> This he ſets forth by foure degrees. 1. By the ſight of God. 2. By the name of God written in their fore-heads. ver. 4. 3. By divine illumination. 4. By the everlaſting Kingdom, ver. 5.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the latter part, (which is a very Patheticall concluſion, reſpecting the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the Propheſie:) three perſons are brought in ſpeaking one after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, every one almoſt twice, <hi>viz.</hi> The Angel: the Lord Ieſus, and Iohn.</p>
                  <p>The Angell <hi>firſt</hi> commends unto Iohn the dignity of this Propheſie, ver. 6. <hi>And he ſaid to me, theſe ſayings.</hi> Rendring two Reaſons: 1. The authority of the Revealer: <hi>The Lord of the Holy Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. 2. The truth of the matter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed: <hi>theſe ſayings are faithfull:</hi> and from the time: <hi>which must ſhortly bee done,</hi> ibid.</p>
                  <p>The Lord Ieſus (firſt promiſing his comming ſhortly) commendeth the Propheſie by its ſaving effect: <hi>Behold I come quickly, Bleſſed is hee that kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Iohn ſetting down his name, repeateth his error in worſhipping of the Angell, and the Angels forbidding him to do it, ver. 8.9. <hi>I John,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The Angel <hi>in the ſecond place</hi> forbids Iohn to keep this Propheſie ſecret, ver. 10. <hi>Seale not:</hi> adding a two-fold reaſon. 1. From the certainty, <hi>becauſe the time is ſhort,</hi> ibid. 2. From a two-fold effect: one hurtfull, accidentary: It ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:96676:315"/>the wicked to wrath, ver. 11. <hi>He that is unjuſt, let him be unjuſt:</hi> the other ſaving and proper: which ſhall confirme them that are righteous and holy: <hi>He that is righteous,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Againe the Lord Ieſus by proclaiming his comming to be at hand (ver 12. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I come quickly</hi>) commendeth the Propheſie (ver. 14. <hi>Bleſſed are they that,</hi> &amp;c.) by divers Arguments: 1. From the end of his comming, ver. 12. <hi>My reward is with mee to give to every man,</hi> &amp;c. 2. From his eternity and conſtancy, ver. 13. <hi>I am Alpha and Omega.</hi> 3. From the profitable effect of the Propheſie. ver. 14. <hi>Bleſſed are,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that they may have right,</hi> &amp;c. 4. From the hurtfull ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of wicked contemners, ver. 15, <hi>For without ſhall be dogs.</hi> 5. From his ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar good-will to the Churches, to whom he would have the Propheſie revealed. This he ſets forth by an <hi>Apostrophe</hi> ver. 16. <hi>I Jeſus have ſent:</hi> and by titles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to himſelfe, <hi>I am the root,</hi> &amp;c. 6. By an argument <hi>from the leſſe: the Spirit, and the Spouſe</hi> (the Church Triumphant) deſire my comming, therefore every faithfull man in the Church-Militant ought to learne from this Propheſie much more to long after the ſame, ver. 17. <hi>And let him that heareth ſay come,</hi> &amp;c. This he amplifies by the profitableneſſe: <hi>Let him take water:</hi> and by the facility, let him take it <hi>freely.</hi> 7. From the inviolable authority of this Book, unto which no man upon paine of damnation may adde, or take ought there-from, ver. 18.19. <hi>For I teſtifie,</hi> &amp;c. He concludes with a repitition of the promiſe of his ſudden com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: <hi>Surely I come quickly,</hi> and cloſeth up all with <hi>Amen,</hi> ver. 20.</p>
                  <p>Iohn applauds, or earneſtly wiſheth the ſame: <hi>Even ſo come Lord Jeſus:</hi> and wiſheth the grace of the Lord Ieſus to all the Churches, and Saints, ver. 21. <hi>The grace of Our Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>To the neceſſity</hi> of a Citie belongs the having of healthfull and potable waters.
<note place="margin">The plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſſe of the City.</note> Vnto <hi>commodiouſneſſe</hi> to have navigable waters. Vnto <hi>pleaſantneſſe</hi> to have Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers running through the midſt of the ſtreets. Hence the Citizens have cleannes, refreſhing, much profit, and delight.</p>
                     <p>All theſe things are here in our Citie, even in a perfect and full degree. For it hath not a Ciſterne, or Well, or one Fountaine of water to drinke off, but a whole River: not muddie, but moſt pure, like unto cleare Chryſtall, not of corruptible water, but of living water, not running downe from the Mountains, whence Rivers take their originall, but proceeding out of the Throne of God and the Lambe: not running about the wals without, but watering the Market and Streets within: I pray what can be imagined more pleaſant and beautifull then this City? who would not deſire to be a dweller therein.</p>
                     <p>But here we are not to mind any thing Earthly. For thus God ſpeakes to us as to children, and by earthly things which ſeem moſt faire and pleaſant unto us, he in ſome meaſure ſhadoweth out the pleaſantneſſe of Heavenly things.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It ſeemes</hi> indeed to be in ſome kind an alluſion unto the <hi>Earthly Paradiſe,</hi> which was watered by the River comming out of <hi>Eden</hi> running through the midſt of it, and divided into <hi>foure heads.</hi> But that River was not cleare as Chryſtall, but drawing filth along with it, neither was it of <hi>living water,</hi> but corruptible, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did it proceed out of the <hi>throne of God and the Lambe,</hi> but out of <hi>Eden:</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Euphrates,</hi> which is yet to this day in <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> and <hi>Babylon.</hi> Therefore the elegancy of the <hi>Earthly Paradiſe</hi> is nothing to the pleaſantneſſe of this Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall Citie.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo an <hi>Alluſion</hi> unto <hi>Ezechiels waters,</hi> Chap. 47.1. whence the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this is taken in a great part.
<note place="margin">Alluſion unto Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiels Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> But thoſe waters do not equall the praiſes of this River. The difference in ſpeciall is, that the <hi>waters in Ezech.</hi> came out of the Temple. But this <hi>River</hi> not ſo, (for the City had no Temple) but out of the throne of God and the Lambe.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon of the diverſity is this,
<note place="margin">Their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſitie.</note> that the Viſion of <hi>Ezechiel</hi> ſets forth the ſtate of the Church-Militant, under Chriſts Kingdome in this Life: and by the type of <hi>waters</hi> flowing out of the temple he ſhadowes out the doctrine of the Goſpell, by which Chriſt (ſignified by the temple) ſhould ſavingly water the whole world. Here is typed out the ſtate of the Church-Triumphant after this life, whoſe <hi>Chryſtaline River</hi> ſhall proceed no longer out of the temple, but immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately <hi>out of the throne of God and the Lambe.</hi> Now this moſt pure River of living water (above in <hi>Chap.</hi> 20.6. called the <hi>Fountaine of living water,</hi> and in <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.17. in the plural, <hi>Fountains of living water,</hi> in the ſame ſenſe) that is, not only al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes flowing, but alſo preſerving eternall life, is nothing elſe, but the full know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, which the Faithfull ſhall have, not by the Eccleſiaſticall Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie, as now: but by the immediate Viſion of God himſelfe and of the Lamb: as alſo the unutterable puritie, conſolation, joy, and life, which the Elect ſhal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy by eternall familiarity with God, Chriſt, and the Holy Angels.</p>
                     <p>By the <hi>River, ANDREAS</hi> underſtandeth the <hi>waſhing of Regeneration or Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm:</hi> but Baptiſme ſhall have no place in the Coeleſtiall Jeruſalem. Therefore
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:96676:316"/>he more fitly addeth: <hi>that this River of God, which abundantly watereth Jeruſalem above, is the holy Ghoſt, which proceeds from the throne of God the Father through the Lambe.</hi> God therefore ſhall immediately vivifie the Elect, and ſhed forth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them his owne light, righteouſneſſe, joy, and life, through the Holy Ghoſt, which proceedeth from the Father and the Son.</p>

                        </gap>) <hi>Divine,</hi> true, profitable, and ſaving unto the Church, and ſo bee ſtirred up unto the continuall meditation thereof. The Holy Ghoſt was not ignorant, that many would call into Queſtion the divine authority of this Booke: for it was a long while rejected, as being compoſed by the hereticke <hi>Cerinthus:</hi> which errour we have before confuted in the Prologue. But they ought to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved the Angell, ſaying: <hi>Theſe words are faithfull and true. Faithfull,</hi> to which we may ſafely give credit. <hi>True,</hi> which ſhall certainly be accompliſhed. And indeed ſo it is: for we, who are now more then fifteen hundred yeers after the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> do, if not ſee with our eyes, yet certainly feel as it were with our hands, the manifeſt accompliſhment almoſt of all the <hi>Viſions.</hi> Here therefore wee have an evident note of divine authoritie and truth imprinted on this Propheſie, againſt the moſt impudent aſſertion of BELLARMINE,

                           </note> the divine authority of Canonicall Bookes of Scripture, may be proved from the ſcripture it ſelfe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Sophiſters and adverſaries of Scripture <hi>object,</hi> that this Argument is not ſufficient to Faith, unleſſe it be before proved and beleeved that the Angell or Writer, uttering theſe things, ſpake truth.</p>
                     <p>ANSWER: <hi>Firſt principles</hi> are not proved, but laid downe and beleeved: becauſe therefore the Holy Scripture is the principle of Chriſtian beleefe: with Chriſtians it needs no proof, but beliefe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> that the ſcripture is divine, and theſe words of the Angell <hi>true</hi> and <hi>faithfull,</hi> is beleeved either by divine or humane Faith.</p>
                     <p>That it may be beleeved by humane Faith, it can bee made out by probable, yea forcing Arguments, as from the majeſty of the matter and ſtyle, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of this Propheſie with other Propheticall Scriptures: But eſpecially from the truth of the Oracles (which we know for the moſt part are fulfilled) tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the <hi>woman in travell, and fleeing into the Wilderneſse,</hi> alſo of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> deceiving the world, of falſe miracles, of the <hi>great whore,</hi> making drunke the Kings of the Earth with the cup of her ſpirituall fornication, &amp;c. For this is <hi>Bellarmines</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in the foreſaid place: <hi>If the praedictions of Scripture touching future things are true, as the event hath proved, why ſhould not the teſtimonies of things preſent be true?</hi> And indeed this his ſaying is alwayes to be retorted againſt Popiſh Sophiſters, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding us: <hi>How we know that the Scriptures are true and divine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But that any man ſhould beleeve this with divine Faith cannot poſſiblie bee effected by outward arguments, unleſſe God by his ſpirit doth inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwade the heart. For divine Faith is not wrought by humane Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:96676:319"/>but wrought in the heart by the teſtimony and power of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Laſtly,</hi> by ſuch kinde of cavelling all Authority both of God and man is made a mocke of, and all Faith both of God and men is taken away. For thus <hi>Adam, Abraham, Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets, who heard God to ſpeake, might have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted: <hi>Who knowes whither it be the voyce of God?</hi> Thus the Apoſtles might have ſhifted off the authority of Chriſt, and Eccleſiaſticall men the authority of the Apoſtles: And why then I pray, may not we much more the Authority of the <hi>Pope?</hi> Touching humane authorities of Hiſtories and Writers what more eaſie, then to object: <hi>whence knoweſt thou, that Cicero, Aristotle, Plinie, or Livie wrote theſe things: or ever had a being in nature?</hi> Thus no Faith ſhould be ſafe, but a meer <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>This Argument of Chriſts Deity is beyond all exception: the which <hi>Eniedinus</hi> the <hi>Samoſatenian</hi> (of whom mention hath often above bin made) durſt not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with.

III. <hi>In regard of the ſecurity of men,</hi> unto whom all theſe things have happened, and yet daily do, <hi>quickly,</hi> that is, ſuddenly and unawares.

                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Behold I come quickly</hi>] It is the voyce of Chriſt, <hi>the Lord God of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi> By this acclamation hee approveth the words of the Angell, that the things revealed <hi>muſt ſhortly be done:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>Indeed they ſhall ſhortly be done,</hi> for I come ſuddenly, or, I will come, to wit, unto judgement, as in ver. 12. For all theſe things muſt be done before I come: but I will come ſhortly. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:96676:320"/>they muſt ſhortly be done. They are no Propheſies which ſhal not begin to be fulfilled til after many ages: even now they begin. Therfore now, even now there is need of comfort:

                        <hi>Bleſſed is he that keepeth</hi>] He commends the Propheſie from its profitableneſſe. Now not onely they doe keep the ſayings of the Propheſie, which diligently ſearch out the accompliſhment of them, but they much more, who conforme their Faith and Life according to the ſame, who <hi>worſhip</hi> not the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and his <hi>Image,</hi> who deteſt the whoredoms of the <hi>whore, flee out of Babylon,</hi> and laſtly who in faith adhere to God and the Lambe. This Argument wee have more largely treated of in the Preface, Chap. 1.3. whence it is taken: Now let it ſuffice to note, that bleſſedneſſe in vaine is promiſed unto the Keepers of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> if it could in no meaſure bee kept. But ſurely it is not promiſed in vaine, and therefore the Viſions of this Booke are not ſo intricate, but that by diligent meditation and obſervation, we may in ſome meaſure finde out the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of them.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>And I John</hi>] John alſo ſpeakes of the ſame thing, aſſerting to us the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the Propheſie, by the teſtimonie of his ſenſes: becauſe he <hi>heard</hi> and <hi>ſaw</hi> al things to be ſo. Now an Eye-witneſſe is worthy of credit, eſpecially he being a good man, yea an Apoſtle: whom the Character alſo here doth not obſcurely ſhew to be the Writer: for thus alſo he confirmeth the truth of his Goſpell by profeſſing himſelfe to be an <hi>Eye-witneſſe</hi> and Faithfull Diſciple of Ieſus Chriſt. And he <hi>that ſaw it,

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And when I had heard and ſeene</hi>] Againe hee recordeth his failing about <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of the Angell,</hi> and that the Angell reproved him for the ſame, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him to <hi>worſhip God onely.</hi> The ſame thing fell out <hi>Chapter</hi> 19.10. ſee the Expoſition there.</p>
                     <p>Some may wonder how an Holy Apoſtle ſhould ſo ſuddenly twice ſtumble at the ſame ſtone. For a little before he heard, that <hi>the Angell was his fellow ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> unto whom to aſcribe the honour of adoration, due unto God alone, was ſacriledge: notwithſtanding forgetting both his failing and reproofe, he againe falleth into the ſame errour of vitious worſhip.</p>
                     <p>Now what ſhould this teach us, but that ſuch is the infirmitie, and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateneſſe of the Saints oftentimes in this life, that except they bee ſuſtained by God, they fall not once, but many times even into the ſame error.</p>
                     <p>In ſpeciall it ſheweth the proneneſſe of our nature unto Idolatry. For if it happened unto the Apoſtle Iohn, that he could not, as it were, abſtaine from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull worſhipping of the creature: what wonder though the Chriſtian world be wholly fallen to worſhip Angels and Saints? yet leaſt the world ſhould abuſe <hi>Johns</hi> example to maintaine their Idolatry: he not onely ingenuouſly confeſſeth his failing, but alſo ſets downe the Angels reproofe, attributing adoration to God onely, that ſuch as fall into the ſame ſin might likewiſe repent.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Worſhip God</hi>] By this thunder-bolt the whole <hi>Idol-worſhip</hi> of Papiſts is daſh't, who not content after Iohns evill example, to worſhip Angels, fall down alſo before dumbe Idols,

                        <hi>Brightman</hi> thinkes that <hi>John</hi> did not fall downe againe to worſhip the Angell: but telleth what happened before <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. <hi>ver.</hi> 10. But the order of the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration argues the contrary. For <hi>John</hi> ſeemeth as it were to bid the Angell now
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:96676:320"/>farewell, and ſo in a way of thankfullnes would againe thus reverence him. The words alſo of the Angell, ver. 9. ſomewhat differing from his former, do argue that Iohn would have worſhipped him the ſecond time. For before hee ſaid: <hi>I am thy fellow ſervant, and of thy brethren, that have the teſtimony of Ieſus.</hi> But here: <hi>I am thy fellow ſervant, and of thy brethren the Prophets, and of them which keep the ſayings of this Booke.</hi> However it be, it is obſerveable that he ſaith: <hi>I fell downe to worſhip him:</hi> therefore he did not yet worſhip him: but compoſed his bodie to do it: wherefore alſo his unſeemly geſture is by the Angell reproved. Whence it appears that Idolaters falling down before Idols, ſin grievouſly, not onely in adoration, but alſo in their idolatrous geſture it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>And he ſaith unto me: Seale not</hi>] Before <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.4. he was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to <hi>Seale the voyces of the thunders:</hi> here hee is forbid by the Angell (for the word <hi>SAITH</hi> belongs to the Angell) to ſeale the words of this Propheſie, which commands ſeeme to be repugnant: but are not: becauſe they reſpect di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times and objects. He was commanded to <hi>Seale the voyces of the thunders, and not to write them,</hi> to ſignifie that the Goſpell ſhould bee deſpiſed in Antichriſts Kingdome, as there we expounded. Here he is forbid to Seale, that is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale this Propheſie, but to publiſh the ſame, that it might be read and known of all, leaſt any man under pretence of ignorance ſhould not beware of Antichriſt. Now it is a metaphor taken from <hi>Notaries</hi> who ſeale Letters, that every one may not read them: Or from <hi>Book-ſellers</hi> who keepe ſuch Bookes ſhut with claſpes, as they will not have read, as above wee ſaid touching the <hi>Booke that was ſhut and ſealed.</hi> For Letters and Books that are ſealed, and ſhut, cannot bee read and underſtood.</p>
                     <p>Now God uſed to command the Prophets to Seale their Propheſies, when the accompliſhment of them ſhould be a long while after, ſo as it was not ſo needfull for the preſent to be read. Thus <hi>Iſaias</hi> is commanded <hi>to Seale the Teſtimony.</hi>

And therefore why ſhould I not render to every man righteous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards according to his worke?

                     <p>Notwithſtanding <hi>Eniedinus</hi> the <hi>Samoſatenian</hi> (that he might put a ſamous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of blaſphemies unto his <hi>Explications,</hi> that is,

                     <p>
                        <hi>First: Theſe things,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are ſpoken either by Christ himſelfe, or by an Angell repreſenting the perſon of Christ:</hi> yea he denyeth that Chriſt ſpake them, but a repreſentative Angell.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer:</hi> That theſe things are ſpoken by Chriſt himſelf, the foregoing verſe doth evidently ſhew. But if an Angell repreſenting Chriſts perſon ſhould ſay: I <hi>am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the firſt and the laſt:</hi> certainly he ſhould lie: like as an Ambaſſadour repreſenting the perſon of God or Caeſar, if he ſhould ſay, I <hi>am God,</hi> I <hi>am Caeſar,</hi> verily he ſhould bee as great a liar, as was <hi>Boniface</hi> VIII. in ſaying, I <hi>am Caeſar.</hi> For Ambaſſadours indeed, ſpeake or treat in the Name of God, or of <hi>Caeſar:</hi> but cannot without treaſon aſſume unto themſelves the names or titles of their Lord.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly</hi> he ſaith, <hi>that this kinde of ſpeech:</hi> I <hi>am Alpha and Omega: is prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biall, by which the first and the last, yet not abſolutely, may be ſignifyed: foraſmuch as Alpha and Omega are not abſolutely the firſt and the laſt, but only of the letters and Greek Elements: neither alwayes and every where: but onely in that order or courſe, in which the Letters of the Alphabet are now ſet downe:
<note place="margin">

ANSVVER: 1. Whatſoever might be ſaid touching the Phraſe: I <hi>am Alpha and Omega:</hi> yet the explication annexed ſtands firme: I <hi>am the beginning and the end, the first and the last:</hi> the which Chriſt ſpeaketh abſolutely of himſelfe, nor can it be applied to any ſave unto God alone: as not ſignifying an <hi>arbitrarie</hi> or <hi>temporarie prioritie, and finallitie,</hi> but that which is abſolute, ſimple and naturall. This alone ſufficeth to confirme our faith and refute the heretick.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. What concernes the order of the Greeke Letters, <hi>Plinie</hi> indeed writeth, that <hi>Omega</hi> was added unto the Greek Alphabet by one <hi>Simonides Melicus,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Trojane Warre:</hi> notwithſtanding the ſaid Author affirmeth out of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that <hi>Alpha</hi> with the Ancients, was alwayes the firſt or beginning of the Letters: whatſoever therefore may be ſaid touching <hi>Omega:</hi> yet if Chriſt be <hi>Alpha,</hi> the beginning, not of the Letters, but abſolutely of all things, then verily he is God Eternall.</p>
                     <p>But neither ſhall the Hereticke thus ſhift it off touching <hi>Omega.</hi>

                        <hi>that theſe words Alpha and Omega, doe ſometime ſignifie time, as in Nicephorus, the Emperours Valentinian, and Gratian write in their Epiſtle:</hi> We indeed have uſed patience, from <hi>Alpha</hi> it ſelfe unto <hi>Omega, that is, from the beginning unto the end.

                     </p>
                     <p>ANSWER: Firſt <hi>Epiphanius Scholaſticus,</hi> who tranſlated the Hiſtorie cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Tripartita,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

We indeed are ſubject to him, who is the firſt and the laſt,</hi> that is, unto God: the which ſenſe the <hi>antitheſis</hi> there following (<hi>but ye do arrogate to your ſelves,</hi> &amp;c.) doth altogether require. For the Emperours by their humilitie in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting themſelves to God, reproved the arrogancy and high-mindedneſſe of the Biſhops, who by their continuall brawlings and contentions abuſed their Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall majeſties. Let the place be looked into: Wherefore theſe words <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>O.</hi> doe ſignifie, not time, but Eternall God, or Eternitie.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Whatſoever may be ſaid touching the place of <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> the Emperors ſay not: <hi>We are Alpha and Omega, the firſt and the laſt:</hi> ſo as Chriſt ſaid: I <hi>am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, the firſt and the laſt.</hi> Therefore that place makes nothing againſt the words of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Although thoſe words in the place alledged might ſignifie time and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance: yet the reaſon for which the adverſarie denyeth that this ſignification is agreeable to Chriſt, is abſolutely falſe and hereticall, viz. <hi>that many things are more ancient and later in age then Chriſt.</hi> For according to his Deity Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth himſelfe to be <hi>Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the firſt and the laſt,</hi> as beeing the onely begotten of the Father before the Mountaines were ſetled.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly</hi> he thus Syllogiſeth: <hi>Relatives are together by nature. The ſon is a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive having a correlative Father: Therefore the Son cannot be before the Father and ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the firſt and the laſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>ANSWER: I. It was never affirmed that the Sonne was before the Father. II. The adverſarie overthrowes himſelfe with his Sophiſtrie: for if <hi>Relatives</hi> are together by nature: as indeed they are: then verily God the Father, and God the Sonne are together by nature: But the Father by nature is the <hi>firſt and laſt,</hi>
                        <pb n="589" facs="tcp:96676:323"/>that is, eternall. Therefore alſo the Sonne by nature is the <hi>firſt and last.</hi> For the Father was never without the Son.</p>
                     <p>FIFTLY he dallieth out of <hi>Martiall,</hi> that theſe words ſignifie the eſteem or worth which men put upon a thing: ſo that which is moſt <hi>excellent,</hi> is called <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Alpha,</hi> that which is moſt <hi>vile</hi> is called <hi>Laſt</hi> and <hi>Omega:</hi> in which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication <hi>Martiall</hi> ſhould have ſaid.

                        <hi>Quod Alpha dixi, Codre penulatorum te nuper. But yet that this ſignification cannot be applied to Chriſt: both becauſe the Father is more worthy then he, himſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing it:</hi> My Father is greater then I: <hi>as alſo becauſe it ſhould follow, if Chriſt bee called Omega, that he is the vileſt and moſt abject of all things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>ANSWER: 1. <hi>Martiall</hi> calleth <hi>Codrus, Alpha Penulatorum,</hi> by a poeticall taunt or ſcoffe, not as being the moſt excellent, but the chiefe or firſt of beggers, that is, pooreſt, according to the Proverbe: CODRO PAUPERIOR, <hi>poorer then Codrus.</hi> But whatſoever he may ſay touching <hi>Alpha:</hi> where hath the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke ever read that <hi>Omega</hi> is put for that which is moſt vile? And though hee had read it: will hee interpret the Divine Revelation by <hi>Martiall</hi> a ſcurrilous Poet?</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Howſoever this ſignification is taken, it is falſe that it is no way to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied unto Chriſt. For Chriſt is <hi>Alpha,</hi> becauſe according to his Deity hee is moſt excellent, the beginning and the firſt of all things: And <hi>Omega,</hi> not as the vileſt, but becauſe he is the end and laſt of all things: for ſo he himſelfe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preteth the ſame.</p>
                     <p>That the Father is more worthy then Chriſt in reſpect of the aſſumption of the fleſh it is true: according to which hee himſelfe ſaid:
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.30. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.10. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.23.</note> 
                        <hi>The Father is greater then I:</hi> in reſpect of his Deity it is falſe, for in this reſpect hee ſaith: <hi>I and the Father are one: I am in the Father and the Father in me:</hi> The Father hath given all judgement to the Son, <hi>that all men ſhould honour the Son, even as they honour the Father.</hi> Wherefore as the Father and the Son are one by nature, ſo in honour and dignity: for which cauſe above <hi>Chapter.</hi> 4.11. &amp; 5.11. the Church-Triumphant aſcribes to God and unto the Lambe, the ſame honour glory and power.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixtly</hi> he reaſoneth from the <hi>Metaphyſickes: That theſe words,</hi> the FIRST and the LAST <hi>ſignifye the cauſe: But Chriſt, as the Trinitaries confeſſe</hi> (thus the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticke termeth Orthodoxe Writers) <hi>hath a cauſe: Therefore he cannot be called the</hi> FIRST <hi>in this ſenſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>ANSWER: 1. Nothing is more frivolous then this kinde of Logicke: for there are foure termes in the Syllogiſme, <hi>to ſignifye the cauſe, and to have a cauſe,</hi> being put for one, which are not one in the leaſt: and from two affirmatives in the ſecond figure, he inferres a negative, then which nothing is more vaine.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The <hi>major</hi> is not true, but of God being abſolutely the <hi>firſt and the laſt, the beginning and the ending,</hi> and therefore he is truely the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>laſt</hi> cauſe of all things: and ſo likewiſe of Chriſt ſaying abſolutely of himſelfe, <hi>I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the firſt and the laſt,</hi> and therefore the firſt and laſt cauſe of all things: but of all others it is falſe. For of what are <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> the cauſe? Is it of the Letters that are betwixt them? And ſuppoſe that the firſt man may in ſome ſort be ſaid to bee the cauſe of others: of whom ſhall the laſt man be the cauſe?</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The <hi>aſſumption</hi> unleſſe it be underſtood with limitation, is falſe alſo: for we confeſſe that Chriſt hath a cauſe not abſolutely, but according to his huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, beeing according to his Deity the creating cauſe of all things with the Father: <hi>For all things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made,

                        <pb n="590" facs="tcp:96676:324"/>or works (in the kind of ſubſtance) in the beginning of time:

                     </p>
                     <p>Thus therefore let the Hereticke learne to correct his <hi>Paralogiſm</hi> or deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full arguing, leaſt he faile in the forme: <hi>Hee that hath a cauſe, is not the firſt and the laſt as the cauſe. Chriſt hath a cauſe. Therefore he is not the firſt and the laſt as the cauſe.</hi> Thus the whole is granted touching Chriſt in reſpect of his humanity: But in reſpect of his divinity, in regard whereof he ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the firſt and the laſt,</hi> the conſequence is denyed, becauſe of the aequivocation of the word <hi>Cauſe:</hi> or the aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is falſe.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore he ſaith: a thing <hi>is ſaid to be firſt, which is by nature before the reſt. Chriſt is not before the Father, becauſe correlatives are together by nature: Therefore Chriſt is not the firſt after this manner.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>ANSWER: This we willingly grant of Chriſt according to the fleſh, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Deity the adverſarie dallieth by foure termes: becauſe <hi>before other things:</hi> and, <hi>before the Father</hi> are two termes, or the <hi>major</hi> univerſally taken is falſe: for in this ſignification he is not the <hi>firſt,</hi> who is before God: elſe God alſo ſhould not bee the firſt by nature, becauſe God is not before himſelfe: But he which is by nature before others, in whoſe reſpect he is ſaid to be the firſt: to wit, before all creatures. Beſides wee may (as before) retort the adverſaries weapon upon himſelfe: <hi>Correlatives</hi> are by nature together: The Father and the Sonne are correlatives, and the Father is the <hi>firſt,</hi> becauſe by nature he is before all: Therefore alſo the Sonne is the firſt, becauſe hee is before all things by nature.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Laſtly</hi> he ſaith, <hi>that a thing is ſaid to be the firſt and the laſt, Alpha and Omega: in regard of order and placing; like as the Firſt Booke of Homer is called Alpha in this Monosticke, or ſingle Verſe:

                              </gap>.</q> Which ſignification,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>is moſt convenient to this place; becauſe God hath appointed Chriſt to be the Firſt Meſſias and Mediatour of the Nations; neither will he give unto him any Succeſſour in this office: this honour he will not give unto another, but Chriſt was, and ſhalbe the Firſt and the Laſt Redeemer; Hence hee is here rightly called Alpha and Omega.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>ANSWER: This indeed is the thing which the Hereticke after all his blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous ſhiftings would needs vomit out. But this ſignification is the ſame with the firſt touching the arbitrarie priority of the Letters <hi>Alpha and Omega:</hi> Why then thus much belching? we deny not that Chriſt alone is ordained the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer by God the Father. But we deny theſe three things.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. That Chriſt in reſpect of his Office of Redemption, calleth himſelfe <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the firſt and the laſt:</hi> which in Scripture are titles onely of the Eternall Deity.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. We deny, that this ſignification and example is agreeable to Chriſt: for he which is <hi>Alpha and Omega, the firſt and the laſt in order</hi> and place (like as the Heretick maketh Chriſt to be <hi>Alpha and Omega,</hi> that is, the firſt and the laſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer) he certainly hath a ſecond, a third, and others betwixt: like as after Homers <hi>Alpha</hi> followeth:

<pb n="591" facs="tcp:96676:324"/>
                        <hi>Omega</hi> alſo <hi>Alpha,</hi> and it ſhould be falſe, that Chriſt in this Office had no Succeſſour, and that he was, as the <hi>Firſt,</hi> ſo the laſt Redeemer.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. We deny, that the Heretick beleeveth, what he ſaith, or that the thing he ſaith is true. For he affirmeth, <hi>that Chriſt was and ſhalbe the firſt and the laſt Redeemer.</hi> Notwithſtanding he beleeveth not, that Chriſt was the Redeemer of Adam, Abraham, and the Fathers of the Old Teſtament: but beleeveth the Fathers were not redeemed by Chriſt, yea that Chriſt had no being, before hee was manifeſted in the fleſh: Both which aſſertions are falſe, hereticall, and blaſphemous.</p>
                     <p>Now briefly wee will bring all the Heretickes ſubtilties into this one <hi>Sophiſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Chriſt is <hi>Alpha and Omega, the firſt and the laſt,</hi> &amp;c. either in a certain order, that is, an arbitrary and temporary priority, and finality (like as <hi>Alpha and Omega</hi> is in the order or ranke of the Greeke Letters:) or in time, or excellency, or as the cauſe, or in priority of nature, or laſtly in order and place: But he is not the firſt and the laſt in time, nor excellency, nor as the cauſe, nor in priority of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Therfore only by an arbitrarie priority, <hi>viz.</hi> in rank, order, and place: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is appointed by God to be the firſt and the laſt Redeemer.</p>
                     <p>ANSWER: 1. The Heretick though he reaſoneth much touching <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>O. the first and the laſt,</hi> yet he meddles not at all with the other title annexed, <hi>the beginning and the end,</hi> becauſe he could not darken the ſame by his cavils. Now ſeeing this Title doth abſolutely denote that Chriſt is he, <hi>from whom,
<note place="margin">

The aſſumption, (as hath been ſhewed) is wholly falſe. III. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is to be denyed: from the inſufficient enumeration of ſignifications: for the Hereticke omits the principle ſignification of <hi>Eternity,</hi> by which properly God is <hi>the first and the last,</hi> Iſa. 14.4. &amp; 44.6. &amp; 18.12.</p>

But let us briefly conſider to whom Chriſt doth teſtifie, what it is, and after what manner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto every man that heareth the words</hi>] This Proteſtation belongs unto all that heare and read the ſame, not one excepted. And therefore neither <hi>Pope</hi> nor <hi>Councell</hi> have any right to adde, or take ought from the Scriptures, but with the hazard of their Salvation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If any man ſhall adde</hi>] The conteſtation conſiſts of two heads: The <hi>firſt</hi> is: that this Propheſie may not be adulterated by any Addition. <hi>To adde,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">What it is to adde to this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie:</note> is not ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly and according to the Analogy of Faith to interpret the meaning of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie: but to mixe other things, beſides what the Lord Ieſus hath revealed by his Angell. <hi>He addeth,</hi> ſaith THOMAS, <hi>which adjoyneth a lye:</hi> for whatſoever is patched to the Scriptures of mens inventions, that it might be accounted as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely revealed, is a lie. Such are the <hi>Popes Traditions,</hi> which (ſeeing hee will make of like authority with the written word of God) he addeth unto the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Therefore they are lies.</p>
                     <p>The other branch of the conteſtation is,
<note place="margin">What it is to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie.</note> that none may deprave this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, by taking away from the words thereof. He not onely <hi>takes away,</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogates from the divine authority of the Booke (which, as Chriſt foreſaw, many would do) but he alſo that any wayes changeth, or maliciouſly perverteth, or contradicteth any thing here written. Of which offence ſuch are not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther free, who obſtinately deny that the manifeſt events of the Types touching the fall of <hi>the great Starre</hi> from Heaven into the Earth, <hi>of the Beaſts aſcending</hi> out of the Sea, and of the <hi>worſhipping of his Image,</hi> and <hi>Character,</hi> of the <hi>Romane Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, of the whore</hi> committing fornication with the kings of the earth, &amp; the like, are not yet manifeſtly fulfilled in the Papacy. <hi>The ſumme</hi> of the conteſtation is, that the integrity, ſincerity, and ſacred Authority of this Propheſie bee faithfully preſerved in the Churches, and that the contemners, falſifiers, and corrupters thereof be no way ſuffered, under paine of <hi>Anathema</hi> or curſe, unto which, as it followeth, that man is liable that preſumes to adde or take away ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from: for he ſaith: <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto him God ſhall adde the plagues</hi>] This is the <hi>reaſon</hi> of the conteſtation, the horrible curſe of them that falſifie this Scripture by adding or detracting. For if Falſifiers of Coine are liable unto the civill curſe of the Law: much more ſhall the <hi>Anathema</hi> of eternall damnation be inflicted upon the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupters of the Scriptures, which are the word of God. <hi>To them that adde thereto,</hi> God will <hi>adde all the plagues of this Booke</hi> (to wit, the Seven laſt plagues) and caſt them into the Lake of fire and brimſtone, with the <hi>Dragon, the Beaſt, and the Falſe-Prophet, Chap.</hi> 19.</p>

19. <hi>And if any man ſhall take away</hi>] That the righteouſneſſe of Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may appeare, he will puniſh the Corrupters of his word, according to the quality of the offence. To Impoſtors he will adde plagues. To them that <hi>take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> God will <hi>take away their part out of the Booke of life,</hi> &amp;c. Their judgement ſhall bee much alike. For as the former are threatned with plagues: ſo the latter ſhall be deprived of all good.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>His part</hi>] Not what he hath, but what he ſeemes to have. He ſpeaketh of the part or portion of eternall life, which ſuch ſhall have as <hi>are written in the Book of Life,</hi> that bleſſedneſſe (I ſay) and Heavenly joy which the Inhabitants of the <hi>Holy Citie</hi> ſhall be partakers of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And from the things which are written</hi>] To wit, which in the Epiſtles of this Propheſie (eſpecially, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.) are promiſed to them that <hi>overcome,</hi> and from the things which in this Book are ſpoken touching the glorious ſtate of the Saints in Heaven, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.9.20.21.22. Now they that ſhall be deprived of Heavenly bleſſings, muſt of neceſſity lie under eternall plagues and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For betwixt theſe, there is no <hi>medium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This place is remarkeable, againſt the Popiſh depravers of the Scriptures. For two things are evidently proved. <hi>Firſt</hi> that the Holy Scripture is Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique in it ſelfe: and that it giveth teſtimony of its owne divine authority. For what is truely ſaid of this Propheſie, is rightly by Expoſiters extended unto the whole Scripture. Hence ANDREAS: <hi>A fearfull curſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall light on them, who are not afraid to adulterate divine Scripture.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>SECONDLY That the Holy Sriptures are ſo perfect in themſelves, as that the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> are to bee held for moſt damned falſifiers, who deny that all Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Faith and Salvation are contained therein, unleſſe the traditions of Rome bee added.

                     <p>ANSWER: Yea both this Booke and all the reſt of Holy Scripture. This appears: becauſe this Booke is the laſt, and laſt written. Therefore this threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning annexed is as the Seale of the whole Cannon, or of all Bookes of divine Scripture.

                        <hi>Ye ſhall not adde unto the word which I command you, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall ye diminiſh ought from it:</hi> So to this laſt Booke he puts the ſame <hi>Seale:</hi> that nothing might be added, made equall or taken away from this, or any other part of Canonicall Scripture.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bellarmine</hi> objecteth to the contrary: that it is not ſaid: <hi>which I have written:</hi> but, <hi>which I have commanded.</hi> But frivolouſly: for Exod. 24.12. God ſaith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly: <hi>Which I have written, that thou mayest teach them.</hi> And Hoſe. 8.12. <hi>I have written to him the great things of this Law.</hi> Adde to this the former reaſon, that all Interpreters do acknowledge this <hi>Anathema</hi> to be pronounced generally againſt all falſiſiers of Scripture,
<note place="margin">Why the oracles of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation are moſt taken out of the old Canon.</note> and that moſt juſtly. For the evident <hi>argument</hi> hereof is, that the greateſt part of this Propheſie is as it were taken word for word out of the <hi>Old Canon,</hi> ſo as the Holy Ghoſt ſeemes purpoſely in every of the <hi>Viſions</hi> to allude unto certaine Propheſies of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> Now the reaſon hereof without Queſtion was: <hi>First</hi> indeed, really to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that there was nothing wanting in the Old Teſtament unto perfection. <hi>Secondly</hi> that by this apparent imitation hee might ſhew, that in the writings of the Old Teſtament is contained the ſtate and condition of the Church of the New Teſtament. <hi>Laſtly</hi> he ſheweth that the <hi>Revelation</hi> is as it were a recapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation of both the Teſtaments, and containeth the ſumme and agreement of all the Holy Scriptures. By the which againe it is plaine that this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent conteſtation or proteſtation belongeth unto the whole Body of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writ.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Even ſo come Lord Jeſus</hi>] Theſe are the words of <hi>John</hi> applauding and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating Chriſt to doe quickly what he promiſeth. He wiſheth therefore, that he may come quickly, not in his owne name onely, but he will have it to bee the common wiſh of all the godly: <hi>Come quickly Lord Jeſus:</hi> And why ſhould wee not wiſh for it? To the wicked the day of the Lord ſhall be terrible. But to us nothing can come more acceptable: becauſe then our Redemption ſhall draw neer, and there ſhall be a perfect deliverance. Then all teares ſhall bee wiped away from our eyes: then we ſhall ſee him, as he is, and live with him for ever and ever.</p>
